{"recommended": true, "review": "Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years. 1. general thoughts and how i started: I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s.  2. Did i waste my youth?: So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that. 3. time invested into dota2: EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING. REWARDING: dota 2 is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R  YOUR RANK GOES \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)).  ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do  CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)"},

Rockstar flat out states that bans are final and can not be appealed.

Comedy gold, great characters with OTT humour blasting their way around Los Santos, couldn't be more fun.  Buying on sale for the single player even if you never go online.... worth it. GTA V Online. Well, where do I start.  The online part of the game leaves you rattling round in public lobbies trying to grind away the cash to buy anything fun, then more stuff comes out that looks fun and you spend more time grinding for that.  Commonly griefed while doing it, often hassled by modders and frequently stuck in the clouds.  Of course there is stuff like the pvp arenas, all the racing types and heists that can be done without joining a crew as well. But, find a good crew..... and all that changes.  With a good crew you can help each other make money, kick the griefers out of sessions, roleplay a motorcycle gang riding around in leather and the game becomes a lot better.  Like most online games, finding decent people to play online with makes all the difference. Rockstar Support No review of GTA would be complete without a quick look at R* support.  Yes the online game has a modder problem, so yes a fairly aggressive anti-cheat is welcome...... regrettably it sometimes functions like a rabid dog and bites whoever it sees.... and from late on 24th to 26th March 2018 it bit a lot.  24th - A bit of code is updated, thousands of people start getting banned for 30 and accounts wiped. 25th - The bans continue, thousands and thousands of bans and accounts wiped, thousands of hours of gameplay gone.  No word from R* about it, support tickets relating to bans autoclosed with a polite \"f**k off reply\" 26th - Bit of code changed on 24th changed back, no word from R*, media gets hold of it, steam reviews tanked.  No new bans 28th - People still banned, no word from R*, support tickets relating to bans no longer autoclosed.  So yeah, that's progress. 29th - So R* has started lifting the false bans, which is great, the downside, when they log in they are getting autobanned again.  The mess continues. So finally, about a week after people got banned, and unbanned and banned again everything is getting sorted out.  I was lucky, I got told what was happening so I didn't log in. Now a lot of people say \"cheaters always whine about getting banned hahahahaha\", but these are people I play with every day, in a crew specifically focused on avoiding cheaters, people I trust in a crew I trust. GTA is a genuinely great game at times, frustrating at others, and a miserable piece of\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665when you have to try dealing with R* themselves. Single player 10/10 Online 5/10 rising to 8/10 with a decent crew. Support and respect for their customers 0/10, nothing, nada, f**k all."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Rockstar can ban suspend/ban your account and completely reset your stats without any warning even when you have no used any mods, picked up modded cash or downloaded a cheat. Rockstar support will not revert your suspension/ban and refuse to look into your case when you ask them to over live support, only giving the same copy/pasted responses of \"all decisions are final and your ban/suspension will not be reverted.\" They will refuse to check whether you are a legitimate player or not and if you are wrongfully banned, say goodbye to all the work you put into your character. Meanwhile actual cheaters have a free reign in public lobbies, able to spawn in unlimited cash, unreleased vehicles, invincibility, the ability to kill anyone not in passive mode instantly. None of them get banned, while thousands of legitimate players do. Consider this a warning before buying."},

Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it. If you're reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up.  I play in private sessions only, for the sole reason to avoid cheaters. It didn't help. You'll get your turn. I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together. Edit:  I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess.  It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected. I will never buy another R* game again and I doubt I am the only one. The way they treat their players is ghastly. Their support desk is insulting. It's all about the money, now more than ever."},

So basically it doesn't matter if you play fair and honest, if theirs stupid anti-cheat go full retard and ban you, there's NOTHING you can do about it. All your progress and time invested is simply gone. Don't get me wrong, the game IS fun, but Rockstar's lack of support and care for the community is simply DISGUSTING."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases. There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance. As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game. Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out: You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits. You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly. You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server) You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof. You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die. All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, \"Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions\" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, \"good\" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation. An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment. People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago? 3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind. This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable. It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "I have always been a supporter of this game. Such depth and reward when learning  and improving at this game during my 10+ years of play. The same goes for previous renditions of this game. However, I have to give this game my first ever bad review. I believe CSGO has entered the worst state it has ever been in. This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous. 90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating. Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor. The developers give no CLEAR information on how this works and what to do to remedy it. Updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state. Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games. As a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the \"FUN\" factor of the game is just disappearing.

There was zero communication between CSGO and the players, you legit just asked if we were free Wednesday, and now I wish I was busy so I never would of have to play this. EDIT: A more structured, critical review. I decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what I saw earlier, and in a completely honest way, I'm still unhappy, but not as unhappy as I was prior. I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this. The Battle Royale When I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales. Pros: - It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre. - Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you. - The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature. Cons (take into account I am biased against battle royales): - It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen. - Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier. - Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me. - The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup. - Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago. Free To Play This is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state. Prime This issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying. Valve in General My issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded. In short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace. Response to comments: @PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs. @JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares? @Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept. @thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man. @waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said.

I don't think I will ever come back to it. I can't imagine going F2P on this game is a good idea purely because of cheaters and scummy players. Matchmaking is awful as is thus i see no reason to TRY to have fun playing. Battle royale? I am waiting for new Need for Speed to have that gamemode too (kappa). I don't know, I am honestly disappointed, once again by this game. Best FPS ever made has actually hit rock bottom by not being itself anymore EDIT I can see that people who have the same opinion as me are usually more experienced, whereas people that are basically new and have under 2 years of playtime would just be toxic and be part of this /perfect cancer-free/ community.

That way, the people who are stuck in MM cheating because they feel like they have no alternative, or have genuinely given up on the game, can finally go clean when they see the positive of a clean competitive game.

{"recommended": true, "review": "Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick: 1. Loading screens take forever. 2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking. 3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done. 4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck. 5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying. 6. The f*cking loading screens X___X 7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up. 8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace. 9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest. 10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.  11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever. 12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol. 13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life. 14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be). 15. And shark cards can gobble my balls. _________________________________________________________________ Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"},

{"recommended": true, "review": "TL;DR Single player game isn\u2019t as good as GTA IV. Only play online if you\u2019re going to cheat. Read on to find out why (long read). I started playing this game in October 2017. I\u2019d just got my sweet gaming rig after using Apple for years due to work obligations.  At the time, I read the negative reviews saying that players who didn\u2019t cheat were getting banned for cheating and everything was being taken away. I scoffed. They must have done   wrong. That wouldn\u2019t happen to me. As someone working full time, I spent around $150 on Shark Cards to unlock missions and the stuff I wanted to do. A sweet ride. A nice motorbike. Harrier jet. I tend to just log on now and again and drive about. Maybe do some Hangar missions. My guy is at level 20. I only have driving and flying skills maxed out. All the other skills aren\u2019t even at level 3. $3 million in the bank. Not really the account of a hacker. Fast forward to May 8th and my account has been banned. It\u2019s a temp ban, but my character is reset and everything I have bought will be taken away from me when the account comes back online in July. Furthermore, if I keep infracting on the games ToS, it\u2019ll be a full ban next time.  This leads to somewhat of a conundrum. Obviously, if I was a cheater, I would know exactly what I had done wrong. However, as a 100% legitimate player, I have no idea what I did, or what warranted this ban. Indeed, if you play legitimately, then how can you play   legitimately in the future? All attempts to contact support have ended in failure. \u201cAll bans are final.\u201d is parroted back at me. No one can tell me why I was banned. This account, then, is ruined. If I know I have done nothing wrong, and as such don\u2019t know why the account was banned, what could I possibly do to prevent a ban in the future? Especially if Rockstar have simply closed the door on me when I ask for help and clarification.  Researching some more into this recent \u201cban wave\u201d to see if there are other honest players banned like me, I discover that used accounts can be bought for as little as $5. In addition to that, there are apparently many free mods and cheats out there that can go relatively undetected online, and unlock  .  Apparently, there are also paid for cheats (I don\u2019t know how much these cost yet), but one gamer I came across seems to maintain that he was banned because he used cheats he\u2019d paid for. If he\u2019d stuck to the free ones, he claims he probably would have been ok. So, for $5, you can have access to everything in GTA V: Online, as well as apparently more (max all skills, max all unlocks, no wanted level, infinite ammo etc.). From personally using Shark Cards, it\u2019s my estimate that to unlock everything legitimately, you\u2019d probably need to pay somewhere between $4000-$5000. As you can see, you can pay $4000-$5000 and get everything, and probably have your account banned, or $5, get everything, and most probably have your account banned. But then after it\u2019s banned, just spend another $5 again. From this I can conclude that there is absolutely no reason to play this game legitimately. There is a high probability you will be banned for no reason and have everything taken away, with no chance to appeal or find out what happened. If you use the cheats, you will also probably be banned, but you\u2019ll have access to everything and may have a lot more fun with all the added extras. Therefore, I highly recommend this game, but   if you\u2019re going to cheat. If you want to play this game legitimately, I would buy something else. Also,  F U C K Rockstar."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "the chinese have 3 servers to choose from but they decide to go to OC and NA servers, mind doing something about that? Edit: OC is the worst, its the closest to their country so thats their first option, i have only found one group of australians in a test of 30 squad battles. This is absolutely ridiculous. But I guess the devs are more interested in making money off crates than actually listening to the thousands of outraged fans Edit 2: Not to mention the fact that the game runs horribly for a simple shooter game that had months of alpha and beta testing. You would think by 1.0 (the FULL RELEASE) that they wouldve at least fixed the optimization problem, let alone the Chinese issue. Until these major issues are fixed i will not be playing the game, and maybe getting people to stop playing the game will hopefully make the devs realise that people dont like the current state of the game, and that their game is at risk of losing a lot of players. Because right now they only care for money and more players, they have no idea how to appeal to their players wishes and make an actual enjoyable game, not just a money making machine."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it? - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or \"xenophobic\" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. - STEREO sound... what year is this?? - Some \"minor\" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor. - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone. If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS. If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens. It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game. All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc. The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact. There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say \"China numba wun\". Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say \"engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite\", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues. PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could \"easily handle 100 players\" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive. Recent tests:    Netcode 101:"},

{"recommended": false, "review": "I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos. Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it. I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it. That was until the official release of 1.0 Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right? LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here. You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything. They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:   In game purchases. It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players. They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms. Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases. Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now: Pros: - Fast queue times due to high player-base, - SOLID graphics. - Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop) Cons: - Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release. EDIT: - PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience. - Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...) - HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times) - Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect. - Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns) - \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone. - EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection. - I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more. ################ Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly. This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it."},

Let me start of by saying that I do not hate the game itself, rather it's the matchmaking and the people that populate the game I hate. Get ready for frustration, tears, screamings, trying to be a psychologist for 40m, working around the issues of every single player, I'm DONE I'm freaking done I played 4.426 hours this, and the obvious reason it's to ask why, why did I do it? Well people get adicted to all sorts of things, look at people that smoke, it's killing them slowly but they get a relief when they get anxious, dota was my tobacco when I felt the anxiety of the day to day life I would resort to dota to calm down the anxiety. The competitive aspect of it appealed to me, and I felt that with enough patiente and fidinig the right people to play with, I could give a shot to being professional no chance. Firt of all I was decent not crazy good or anything, but when I tried to be reasonable with my team, when I counter the enemy, when I played whatever role or hero was needed, in other words to help the team whatever their needs were. The more I tried to be as understanding the more I failed, because people didn't want to play the game as it is design, instead they want to bring their issues into the table and for you to deal with them. And after playing up and down the the ranking ladder for a big time. I transition into a freaking range monster at times I would stop and listen to what I was saying and I could felt the toxicity driping off my mouth. I couldn't take it, when people  decided they were going to be afk because certain demands weren't meet or when someone got frustrated and proceded to feed and on and on and on. That is my complain, make no mistake dota is highly competitive game, if the matchmaking doesn't match you with people on your level, your are going to roll on the spiral of frustration, and there's a lot of kids playing just for trolling purposes, the matchmaking sometime matches you with people that have 200 hours when you just simply wonder How? Avoid this massive pit of frustration. You'll thank me later when you have an anxiety free life. El fideo Rubio."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "After being a part of dota 2 community since 2012 when it was not as toxic as it is now i am really sad to give this game a bad review. Not because of gameplay or Community. But for the automated report system this game has which is broken and is abused by kids on the regular. Community as toxic as it is which gives no regards to u but themselves should not be given the priviledge to report someone over false acusations not when the system is automated and the reports that they make are just taken in count never reviewed. This creates a lot of possibilities as people can report u for playing good and o' believe me they will. Today it has come to this point where people are being reported for not sucking in game and are sent to low priority no matter what the cause as cause doesnt really matter when its not looked into. As a dota 2 fanatic i would say this game is a masterpiece even with the community as toxic as it is if u know how to handle it. But if that community is given the power to shove random people into low priority for no real reason i think its high time i leave steam as a whole because they dont understand how the gaming world works and their support are monkeys on the keyboard . As i think Valves new Employees are a bunch of kids as well."},

This game is a testament to how the vast majority human beings possess selfishness beyond limits and stupidity beyond measure. The community of this game is evidence that we truly live with a \"coddled generation\" of children who were raised to believe that they are special and unique and superior to all other people and can literally do no wrong.

{"recommended": false, "review": "After over 3000 hours of gameplay, I can safely sum Dota 2 up in two words: THE TRENCH (aka Forced Fifty) You will win. You will lose. You will improve your skill, but you will never improve your score.  --wait for it-- No. Matter. What.  Why? Because of THE TRENCH / ForcedFifty.  -The better you get at this game, the worse your teammates will be. This is not a paradigm, it is mechanically programmed into the game.  -If you can carry 1 idiot on your team, the game will handicap you with 2. Skilled enough to carry 2? After a few games you will get 3. Hardcore enough for 3? Now you get FOUR-ever.  -Your teammates will -- i \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you not\uff0d\uff0d go out of their way to lose on purpose. You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight. This is the only game where teammates ENJOY LOSING because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level.  -People literally buy and sell accounts off MMR because of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes. Have fun wasting hours of your time on 4k MMR (the alleged decent tier) while you witness first hand feeders lose you the game minute by minute.  I could have been a doctor with those 3000 hours."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "After years of playing this game, i can say it doesn't worth your time. I never wrote a review though. It's time to close this chapter and leave here a blueprint of my experience. It's a good game looking at it at the aspect of graphics, mechanics or even design in general. The idea behind this game,  honestly, is very good. Especially if you have 4 other friends to play it with would be fun.   If you appreciate your time, it's not a good choice though. Here's why: 1. No surrender.  Matches can last up to 1 hour and a half, aproximately. There is a chance that you can't win from minute 30 or 20. To popstone the game from minute 20, if your enemy wants to have fun or you don't give up because you can't accept that you are going to loose anyway OR having teamates that don't give up it's really a waste of time. As pointed out before you have NOT the option to surrender. If you stack with someone that didn't like your move or something and he curses or flames you all game you have to wait until the game ends. If you leave, theres a punishment. You have an option to mute the players but if this someone wants to, he can sabotage you ingame. 2. Rewarding with MMR. No one understands it and the developers doesn't give clues. You don't really know where to focus. Furthermore, winning in solo Ranked is just a matter of luck. Yes, if you are a DOTA 2 God you can win. But, if your role is out of the meta, i think it's really a matter of luck. 3. Products. There are things that you have to pay in order to use them. Like Roles MatchMaking or cosmetics or hero chat phrases. In my opinion, what the developers have to offer in compare with the price is, simple, not worth. MatchMaking Roles, for example, as far as i know, are in a lot of other MOBA games, if not all, a standar feature. Being, one of the largest games in the market, i think you owe to offer that feature. Furthermore, Battle Pass quality declines every year. It needs a lot of money to have access to cool features and have fun with them. Leveling something with money, having the cool things untouchable for the poor guys to reach them is kind of sad, in my opinion. 4. The community. I was one of the good guys, for years. Not yelling or flaming in game. Being teachful and helpful. Didn't answer to insults or flames. However, im not that guy anymore. The community changed me and today i saw it clear. I have read articles about ingame mechanics, the meta, builds and strategy. I trained hard. Well, somedays you can't play well or you don't have that wow game or the other is better than you in your lane! Noone will understand it. Flames, curses and insults are all over you. The funny thing is you are not going to understand it either after plenty of games, according to my experience. Before you start this game, consider the quality of your time! Thanks for your time."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So much fun that you'll lose your mind and before you know it you've spent 2000 hours on it and you're left an empty shell of the person you were. This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you can't stop playing because of the high you get when you win an 80 minute comeback game against  mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel.  Dota 2 takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbf**k and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.It's also got he highest concentration of Dunning\u2013Kruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valve's terrible low priority system doesn't help. Assuming you're a masochist and you aren't deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota 2 you get...... 115 heroes, 100+ items,hundreds of 5 hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota 2 has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a 95.5% pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced. And if you're a gambling man, dota 2 is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game you've ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN. Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, you're never good enough....and you'll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and $h1t  and you never realize it's not real till you're in too deep."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "This is coming from someone who loves dota and has put a pretty decent amount of time into it, but let me tell you it really wasnt worth it. This comminuty is without a doubt the absolute worst I have ever played with in a video game. I have played a LOT of games, but nothing comes even close to describing how horrible the players are. Every single game you play, your teamates will constantly bicker and fight with each other like children, and should you ever find yourself on the other end of this bickering, just prepare to quit now. Every single person on your team looks for one person to blame, and if that person gets blamed they will not ever hear the end of it for the horrible hour some matches can last. THe most fun I had in this game were when I was just playing with my friends and just having a good time. Only because I didnt have o play with random people. But most of the community is fedora wearing grease stained neckbeards that lose their\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665so easily. I understand that it is a competetive game and all but it makes me angry when some new player just wants to play but even in casual games people are so toxic. If your team isnt toxic enough, the opposing team certainly will be. I have a feeling that the most typed thing in this games chat is EZ. The enemy team will constanly spam WP EZ at you every time you make a mistake. I know some prick will say, Duhh you are just complaing cuz ur bad, or just mute them duh, or every game is toxic dota is no different but let me tell you, if you think any of those things you are the type of person ruining my beloved game.  That is what really huurts the most, that I love this game. I love the idea and the gameplay and really everything about it, but the community is so unbearable that i just feel disgusted after every game I play. Even if my team wins my teamates are just telling how awful the enemy team they are and honestly I am just sick of hearing those sorts of things. But if you have 4 other people to play with this game can be a whole lot of fun, and if chill people wanna play together then feel free to add me, but other then that im just sick of dealing with such a disgusting grease riddled community."},

Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore. : Very, very, very, few people you meet will be friendly. Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn. : Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner. : You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go. : The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all. : With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny. : Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers. : Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players.  All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience."},

Too often has Valve demonstrated its lack of utter respect towards this playerbase.

I'm not even talking about the stupid as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 AI that likes to run around in circles while watching you get pounded to death by a charger. Or about the fact that for weeks now half of your servers have been completely unplayable.  Nope, your priority was to remove what is for many of us an entertaining and beloved part of the game, and what for some people completely SHAPES their L4D2 experience. Nevermind the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam that rave about the workshop mods! Nevermind about the few thousands of dedicated Versus players that don't want anything to do with local servers! Just lift a giant middle fingers to those who have kept the game alive for years. It's still completely okay to change your lerp though, right? GG Valve."},

Bring back addons for multiplayer, or this game is dead. What were the devs even thinking."},

If you want to play a game with no mods on PvP (versus) but still have mods on the co-op game modes, then this game is for you. If you only want to play this game for its PvP gamemode and want mods, then don't. Go somewhere else and find another game. I personally love L4D2 but, as of the 11/01/2018 update, my opinion of the game has gone down quite a bit. The update removed mods for the versus mode of L4D2 due to players that installed unfair mods on versus. To sum it all up, If you like PvP with mods, don't buy it. If you like PvP without mods however, then this game is for you. And finally, if you enjoy co-op with or without mods, go ahead and buy it."},

Custom HUD?  Having the ability to make the game tweaked to every little detail, just how I like it?  Absolutely fantastic.  I've been checking the workshop and putting together my addon collection since 2013. And now you take that away from us? I'll be honest, I always preferred campaign.  I did.

The versus mode is the most popular online mode, and its fun, when you can get a balanced game going. This is almost impossible to accomplish, however. Im not sure how many versus games Ive played... maybe 100? Out of those, 2... TWO have been balanced games. Both those times my team lost point wise, but we all won because everyone had lots of fun. The remaining 98 have been total routes for one side the entire match. Even on the winning side, its just not very fun. Also, happen to not play with absolute perfection? You get vote kicked, despite you probably doing better than the other 3 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s your with.

From what I gather the community has deteriorated over time. I wish I had gotten this when it was new. Unfortunately I didnt even know it had come out. Gameplay wise, the game could use some tweaking. There are several blatantly unbalanced \"quirks\" this game has, that detract from an otherwise balanced experienced. But overall its well done and fun to play. The game alone is enjoyably designed for the most part. Unfortunately this being a co-op centered game, the community brings down the games final rating by several notchs, since the community is integral to this games experience. Possibly recommended when on sale just to give it a try."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So I've owned rust for maybe 3 years, played on and off, and for the most part enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong rust in itself is a good game. The BP systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need, but it works. Harvesting, building a base, exploring and having the occasional firefight is also fun (talking about when i started 3 years ago) The game looks good, runs well and have very frequent updates - 3 years on.  The one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far the worst community i've had the misfortune of experiencing - ALTHOUGH, I have met a handful of decent players. When I started out 3 years ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse, and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable. You used to be able to mill about, collect reasources, build a base and get going without too much of an issue. The people you would come across would, more often than not, be friendly and leave you to your own devices. Of coure you would get the occasional hostile, but it generally wasn't that bad. Unfortunately, now it is a much different story. 99/100 people will kill you on sight, even if it is within seconds of respawning... they will also often flame you out over the mic. I've heard every insult, racial slur and homophobic insult many times, every play session. The trend at the moment is to greet you, tell you about how they are friendly, wait for you to let your guard down and then kill you. Many players will scream about being friendly and then kill you straight after.  For the record I am one of the few friendly players in the game, but it gets very wearing after a while when everyone just wants to pretend to be friendly, kill you and then insult you over the mic. Yes, I expect to get killed, raided etc in rust, but dont expect it every 2 minutes. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how new players will even begin to get to grips with rust - you simple do not have enough time from spawning to learn. I've seen quite a few get completely disheartened and quite on their first server. Rust is not a \"pure pvp csgo cod shooter\", yet so many players seem to treat it like it is. I like to play games to have fun, and rust was... once upon a time. Just not anymore.  There is no penalty for running around and being an anti-social, toxic, idiot. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around insulting, trolling and greifing as much as you like, along with forgetting how to interact with another humans in a normal way and nothing will ever happen. Rack up millions of kos kills, nothing happens. Just because I play a game like rust doesn't mean I have lose all sense of decency when I interact with people. Yet 99% of players do and it is incredibly sad. There is a reason the community on rust is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as rust is a good game...without 99% of the other players. People who read this review can tell me to 'get gud' as much as the like, or whatever insults you have stored up your sleeves, but at the end of the day there comes a point where the toxicity becomes too much and it's just not fun... Welcome to Rust. It's a shame I cannot recommend rust as it is up there with being one of my favourites. The community has just sucked out the last bit of fun for me. Edit - Im not against the idea of rust (included raiding, fighting etc etc etc). Im solely talking about the players and how they interact with you. It's really killing the game."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "The issue I have with the game, is by far, its community. PROS: -Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world - Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats. - The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them. - Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air. - Building is interesting and fun. - exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun. CONS: - The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom* - Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate. - Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly - Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy - No costomizability *this is very minor* - KOS; COD style. -Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually. NOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even \"Just like in real life\"       Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this: 1) Spawn, get materials build a small base 2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665br>3) establish dominance in your area 4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle 5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored.  6) Make four excuses : \"Git Gud\" , \"Become like us\" , \"Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it\" , \"Man salty nakeds\"  I once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to \"git Gud\". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers.       It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare.       The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible. Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan.       The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year. But for now, ill try and develope my own game, and see if I can fix these issues myself. --> DISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones. But I myself am unable to confirm this as University and studies are taking up more and more of my time and as such i am unable to actually recheck any of my above statements."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "456 Hours of Rust at this time. Here comes my review on the game in it's current state: Rust is an amazing game, one of, if not the best survival games on Steam right now. But the thing that drives everyone, literally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing everyone away from it, is it's community. The community in Rust is quite possible the most toxic and unfair group of people you will ever lay your eyes upon and you might truly think they all deserve to die, they might. On modded servers where you don't have to farm for an hour before you're able to even think of getting a base, still, it's nigh impossible to play without a group of 4 people or more because you will be demolished by every squeaker who gets a waterpipe regardless of skill. Now on vanilla servers....where the gather rate is NORMAL....there comes to issue of a broken keyboard/monitor etc. you will be out alone for a VERY long time and the second you run into one person with better things than you, you have to start over ALL. OVER. AGAIN. It's very repetitive unless you have a group of your closest friends to play with you so you don't get destroyed. On the decent side, again, Rust is a very amazing game without the community, with great building systems, radtowns to find loot, and an amazing world to explore. But once more, stay away from this game until the community grows up and finally finishes 3rd grade, or you have a group of friends to enjoy the game with you."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Hi there. ive been playing rust for a few months now.  recently ive been playing alot of solo. it gives me a greater sense of freedom. achievement.  But, ive stopped playing now. I really love this game so much, but the way the game is now, it wants you to play every hour of the day. especialy with the way cupboards and decay works. wanna take a day, or 2 break from the game?  Nope. wanna do that without your base getting turned over? Nope but thats just rust. and i accept that. solo rust is hard mode. i accept that. but when your farming. and 3 guys, fully geared jump you, theres nothing you can do. same sort goes for the rad towns. you always. ALWAYS got a group of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing roof campers at most of the radtowns. its \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t. but as a solo player ive gotten to the point where i just cant be bothered to play like this. some of you will say. git gud. or go play minecraft. well tbh i rather would go play minecraft at this point. atleast its not the most stressful \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game in the world. that near enough gives you a heart attack when you get suprised headshot. I do NOT recommend getting Rust unless it's on sale perhaps. Thanks for reading."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So I know what you're thinking. Another negative game review for a game that is getting great press. How could this person be so ignorant of the majesty that is RUST? However, there is a specific reason I'm giving this game thumbs down. It will not go anywhere, it will take your 20 bucks unless you get it on sale, and say thank you for your money, and it will leave you feeling in some way molested after the experience of playing it for a few days. Let me first start off by saying the game is fairly well put together as far as it\u2019s landscape. The game map has very few clipping issues, or pit falls that will leave you stuck, and unable to retrieve your gear if you can get back to your gear before it disappears. The higher end guns and ammunitions work fairly well together, and the graphics are pretty good up to this point in the games development, so I can\u2019t give it bad marks in these regards. With that said I must commence with the game breaking negatives this game has to offer. After a few romps around different servers it has become clear that the game engine of this game is so full of security holes it could be used as a cheese grater. What could have been an awesome game has been reduced down to a slew of game cracking trolls that spend their time finding exploits to the game that allow them to fly, summon in anything they want, and know exactly were you are on the map at all times so that they can kill you and laugh. After reading up on the web about this wonderful game breaking experience, I was sad to see that the game engine used for the game is the cause of this slew of security problems. In short, the game designers would have to completely port this game over to another game engine just to fix the issue of hackers galore. Meaning they would have to start from scratch. This game is in Alpha stage, and I understand that the company still can say that it\u2019s in Alpha stage and it will still have problems. The issue is the game will stay in Alpha stage. The majority of people that want/wanted to play this game have come and gone, the player base has been destroyed. For a game that is to be a multi player game it will not have the multi player community after it\u2019s all said and done. Please, I beg of anyone thinking about playing this game to just say no. If you want to end up either dropping the game after a few days of play, or turning into a Troll, please stay clear of RUST. In truth please stay clear of any game that says ALPHA in its description. At least with a BETA game you can say it\u2019s past the majority of its development issues. I don\u2019t care what age, race, or gender you are. It\u2019s your responsibility as the player to put a stop to game companies wanting to get the juice out of a lemon before it\u2019s ripe. And in the case of RUST I will chalk this game up as a learning experience. Edited 7/3/2014 OK, so I have to give the makers of this game major Brownie Points. they're actualy going to restart the game over on another game engine. Seriously this takes big man tenders to actualy accept the fact your product isn't going to work, and put forth the effort to fix it. Hats off to you guys working on this game, but still until the new release commes out, and it proves to be a lot more stable I'm going to keep this review up on your site. maybe some day I'll switch it over to a recommended."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Pro: Can be fun, can be rewarding. Con: The fun is constantly drained and destroyed by other players. Rust is extremely difficult to play if you cannot spend a significant part of each day online keeping your hard earned stuff safe. Offline raiding is a curse for the casual player, you just can't get anywhere if you only play a few hours per week. God forbid you are a solo; you spend 3 hours building the most minmal base to simply start an existance then come back 2 days later to find it destroyed/griefed or taken over. If you are budgeting less than 3 hours PER DAY to play this game EVERY DAY, don't buy it. The gameplay promotes toxic player interaction; the weaker are continually preyed upon by the stronger, irrespective of the total lack of gain for the stronger player to grief the weaker. The fact that you just spent your entire weekly budget of playtime building yet another starter base, only to have it raided - again - by a bunch of high level chadbags that don't even need your pathetic equipment doesn't enter in to the decision making calculus of the average no-life basement dwelling socially inept tween/teen/pre-pubescant squeaker virgins that play this game. You have been warned."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Ok so played this game a ton and enjoyed past versions but the way it is now and at final release is terrible. The devs have purposfully made it so you cannot enjoy this game as  a new player and in my opinion taken away the essence of rust  and made it just a longer term battle royale game for the following reasons 1. Impossible as a solo player unless you play on a dead server or a solo only server (which just go play a farming sim in that case) you will most likely never see or touch a gun as the large groups of expierienced players will kill you every 2-3 steps and due to them nerfing the bow and spear (the only obtainable weps for you) it is highly unlikely you will kill any of them  2. The game is so old and toxic that finding a solid group requires either slaving for 100+hours or geting extreemly lucky because most established groups kill on sight 3 Its not what made rust popular anymore in the since that no one talks over vaciinity mic. Which means people will not communicate with you besides the \"haha get owned \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\" that occures after 4 of them shoot you to death as you try to eek together enough wood for a spear 4. Because no one uses the mic anymore the community aspect of the game has deteriorated. People used to help newbies and and least say a few things before the shots ring out.. the only thing you should expect to hear from other players is a gunshot sound followed by your screen going black And to those trolls who are undoubtly going to say \"mad cause your just bad\" I played the full expierience was in a succesfull clan for ahwile and solo'd to  some degree of success for the last year or so. My point is not that the games to difficult its that its unfair and if you happen to be a FPS god you will have much more fun on other games. But if your thinking about buying this game without ever playing it b4 i strongly suggest you save your wallet. Ive got 800+hours in this game and wish i could return it now"},

Whether it is building a base or hunting animals, it's a fun game. But spawning in and dying from guns and crossbows for no reason is a terrible experience and this is what happens 90% of the time. I've encountered this problem so many times over my 60 hours of playtime. Once I loaded into a server with 100 people on it and started to grind for 1 hour to build a base for my friends and somebody with a crossbow and shotgun and killed me, for doing NOTHING! The rust community is by far one of the worst gaming communities I have ever played in. This game is good if you have friends who are willing to tough it out and try and counter these scumbags.

{"recommended": false, "review": "To be clear i didnt always hate this game and indeed it was fun but honestly now it is nothing like what was promised Let me tell you all a story once upon a time there was a young handsome strong man who was in an apocolypse in which people spawn out of the ground naked women are gone and nearly all things have been forgoten (including circumsizion) the young man worked hard an built a shack he was shot by a man who took all his firewood  The man respawned and was rocked to death while building a fire then rocked again  and again finaly he found a friendly and then another and another and inbetween a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665who they killed then they found another 3 friendlies. They built the starving african village where they all lived in shacks no one had a weapon better than a bow or a metal hatchet they went to the radzone and found zombies to kill and food and some sacks. One day great warriors came and built a massive mountain of wood 50 steps from thier home. then every day three times a day they attacked the village and demanded tribute the africans hid in thier huts and left food and charcoal in the fire pit for the great warriors. The africans were sad and no one had any clothes except one man with a turban. One day the great metal sky god apeared and dropped his gifts to the world and the invaders left to recieve his gifts and blessings. The starving african village took the whole day to build and got a small long house and a great weapon that fired metal which they put a metal torch on and hid next to the metal doors of the longhouse in a sack. The africans felt strong they all had clothes and hatchets and bows and a single fire stick that could be held in one hand the next day they left no tribute for the great warriors and they attacked the long house and used explosives on the doors of metal the africans fought back and were utterly crushed and forced to leave the land of thier ancestors where they had starved to death so many times before due to lack of chicken and they were killed everywhere they went every time. THIS WAS THE BEST TIME EVER IN THE GAME  I got the game during the dutch auction phase which proposed it as a primarily eve survival game with zombies and extreme threat of cold and hunger. Now there are no zombies because they were removed ( dispite this bieng promised earlier when it was originaly released) and there is nothing but pvp they only focus on that adding weapons while water still does nothing and there is not thirst. its really sad all people do is attack freshspawns and take thier stuff even though they only live in a shack and have 1 piece of chicken a stone hatchet and a pair of socks and a hand full of rocks.  Next complaint sleeper system... Worst idea i have ever heard. Combat logging was the only way freshspawns and friendlys could keep gear and now they cant log off safely even outside of combat. One time i was given a full kit of m4s shotgun c4 and full kevlar the server was laggy and i disconected. Join back 2 mintues later i have been killed with a rock and have nothng. Next complaint combat. It is entirely unfair people who have kevlar and m4s attack people and are impossible to kill for anyone without incredible weapons. it doesnt matter what you do shoot them 5 times with your pistol send an arrow literaly through thier skull so you see it going in and out both sides or unloading clips of ammo on them because they have medkits in thier hot bar so all they gotta do is press 5 when they get hit 6 times and they wont die dumbest idea to have instant healing kits.  Radzones are now so hard to get into people either block them off or there are so many bears/ wolves that you need guns and armor and pills to get in and out so why even have them its not like the loot there is even that good  the map itself is actualy pretty small and only has one road  and how long has this been pre alpha its terrible  THIS GAME HAD POTENTAIL IT WAS SOMETHING FUN ONCE BUT I WAS LIED TO AND IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS PROMISED TO BE INSTEAD OF A GREAT CRAFTING AND BUILDING ZOMBIE FREE ROAM RPG EVE THIS IS A PVP WITH BEARS AND INSTA HEALS AND YOU LOG OFF AND WAKE UP DEAD WITH NOTHING NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOGGED OFF I HATE THIS GAME NOW AND I HAVE UNINSTALLED IT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITS TRASH"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "I've played since 2015, so I'm not a veteran in this game. Rust used to be great, but it's just gotten worse and worse. The game looks really good. The devs update every month. Fun interactions with other players if they don't shoot you in the head. Creative base-building. Great PvP-system. First off is the community, which is probably the worst one out there. The devs encourage zergs, so there is no point in playing solo, because everyone is toxic, childish and an upright crackhead.  Official servers are the most popular, but they are filled with hackers, so no need to play there. Community servers are better, but people leave them after a couple of days because of griefing, and the current \"blueprint\" and component system being a punishment, not a reward. The main problem I have with the devs is that once they fix something, they find something else to intentionally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. They made the component system better, but then introduced the ability to let other players build on your base. Great.  They started making the current system better, then introduced an upkeep system. This basically means you have to divorce your wife, quit your job and move back to your mother's basement in order to play the game, because you have to be on everyday maintaining your base. When I started playing you had a pure blueprint system, which was more or less flawless. It was completely random what blueprints you could get. The only grind was farming resources. Simple, progressive, fun. Now when you start you'll farm resources to build your base. Then you farm resources to upkeep your base. Then you farm components so you can create items. Then you farm scrap so you can research whatever you find and craft it aga-- scratch that, you have to prioritize having the scrap go towards something called a workbench, which is expensive as balls. Once you've made the three different workbenches, you can start researching items. Then you farm these amazing blueprints you find in the world, which includes game changing items like a rug, a table and a chair. When you finally get a hazmat suit, you'll explore the launchsite. If you're lucky you won't face a 15 man zerg there, and get to the top. There you'll find these amazing elite crates which contains super items like the chainlink fence, gears and an SMG body. I. CALL. WORTH. Would be logical to expect a solid base after investing 10-20 hours over a weekend, right? No problem. Just remember to log on every day for the next month to farm more resources so your base doesn't despawn because of a ridiculous upkeep system. I could go on and on about the problems this game currently has, and trust me, there's plenty. So should you buy it? Nope. This game recently came out of early access, which means the devs are very happy with the state and directon of the game. Just know this, paying 30\u00a3 for the game goes directly to the head dev researching the state of spoiled pickles over the course of a year. Amazing.  4/10  Stay away"},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Yes, this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain. Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all. But don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.) So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive. So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay. Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items. Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do. Speaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others. There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them. I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates \u201c%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11\u201d and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours\u00a0\u2014\u00a0its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay. Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. \u201cEasy to learn, difficult to master\u201d\u00a0\u2014 yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did. Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality. There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life\u00a03 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept. But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff)."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "A teenage developer who manages to realease great updates every week, new, detailed maps several times a year and no pay to win; this is my type of game.  500 hours and still enjoying myself, the Gold Upgrade lets you change the colour of your skin (Possible to abuse as camoflague, however, but no other advantages of any kind. It is more a donation than a DLC. That's why I bought it, this guy deserves it. EDIT: This review is recieving a lot of critique, to clear up: Most free to play games rely on overpowered bonuses to get people to buy in game products. This game lets you camoflague better and have more storage space. As a comparison, for a free to play game, this really isn't bad. EDIT 2: It's free to play, it seems you are all expecting free to play games to be pitch perfect AAA games developed by a team of 100 experienced developers. This is a one man operation. For the price you are paying and what you are getting, this is a good game."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Easily one of the best free to play games on Steam. This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do.  You only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time! The beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is.  I still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to \"donate\" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no \"BUY HP FOR 5$\", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to \"Premium\" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it. There's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :) There are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness  percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it. Do you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue! There's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates.  Score: 8/10"},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Okay as I've lately gained interest in this again since 2014 and I've played it a lot more, this is my review for \"Unturned\" (scroll to bottom for TL;DR) Things have improved A LOT since it's first release that I will list. - Map, the map is no longer \"Canada\" it is now still placed in Canada but now Prince Edward Islands which I have to say is a lot better than the Canada map. (imo) - Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills. - Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size. - Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice. There are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS. - Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles. - Vehicles, holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2). - Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses. I doubt you'll run this game bad though. |x| Thanks for reading my review, If you have anything to ask me or want me to add, shoot a comment on this review. |x| TL;DR : Game has improved a lot over the course of a year and he's planning more like a new map set in america and a bunch of weapons."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "I loved this game, so fun. the fact that Nelson ties the community into the development well is awesome. during my 314.2 hours with this game, ive blown up more things than i can count. ive met some of my friends I now know from this game, and I never regret the moment i pressed play game, with the free to play mark next to that green button. if this game ever goes cash bought, i would buy it, and Im sure many of us players would too. keep up the great work Nelson, and do the do's that other f2p games have failed at."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "The term 'Free-to-Play' is slapped onto the side of a lot of games nowadays and it rarely lives up to expectations, with many of them carrying the undertone of 'Pay-to-Win'. With Unturned this isn't the case. The game is a completely free to play zombie survival game, there is an option to pay to upgrade this to a Gold membership however this is purely for aesthetic purposes - Newer/slick UI, extra character model customisations, Gold username displays on the in-game chat, you can also gain access to gold-member-only servers with a few % bonuses like exp and loot but this is a level playing field as you can only play with other Gold members with these bonuses. I don't wish to give much away about the gameplay but the game is awesome to play with friends and you can set up your own private servers fairly easily. There are a few bits and pieces that I feel   and most-likely   be improved in the near future: (There is currently a huge overhaul in development to the game so these points may/may not be valid once the update is live) These aside, I love the simple, blocky graphics, the open world feel, the insatiable appetite of your character - same goes for the zombies, the weapons and attachments, the survival mechanics, the trust issues, the uneasy silences, the countless naked respawns etc etc. I would really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys surviving with friends."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a \"Blam\" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing.  TL;DR: Play the game, don't play on severs with admins."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Unturned is phenomenal game. The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want. Unturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment. Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Since there's hardly any actual reviews regarding this game with factual information, I've decided to write one. This game is a free-to-play steam game, so obviously anyone can really play this. That being said, unturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weapons, food, water, and other resources to stay alive. So far there are 3 (official) maps implimented into the game. It's possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop. You can play this game by yourself, with friends, or just join a multiplayer server. The game offers PVP and PVE game types. The game offers 3 difficulty types: easy, normal, and hard. If you do play this game and decide you like it, you can always purchase the \"Permanent Gold Upgrade\" for $4.99 which gives you a few gold items for your character. The money goes to Nelson Sexton, the creator of Unturned. Anyway with that review being said, let's list the pro's and con's! Pro's: -Free-to-play (unless you decide to support Nelson buy purchasing the gold upgrade) -Fun to play for any age group -Ability to play on a private server with friends (using hamachi) -Crafting system -Level up/skills system -Free form building and the ability to create your own base -Many different weapons and items -Huge maps that offer a lot of stuff to do Con's: -The community on servers is cancer. They're basically a 10 year old version of DayZ or H1Z1 players. -The hit range can sometimes be a bother. Seems like zombies can hit you a lot farther away than you can hit them. -The night cycle seems rather long. Anyway that's my review, I hope it helped."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So atm I have 1700+ hours on Unturned, I haven't played seriously in over a year, and I don't think I will come back to 3.0. When was the last time you actually saw someone try to survive in Unturned 3.0 as they normally would in a zombie apocalypse? When was the last time you saw someone take to farming or fishing to survive? That's right, you don't. Actually, if you search \"Unturned\" on youtube, you get no indication at all that it is, in fact, a zombie survival game. The one glaring issue with Unturned 3.0 is that the community ruined the game for itself. I say that because we have officially optimized the fun and charm out of it. It has transformed from an unforgiving survival game into a daycare reminiscent of Minecraft Factions. You could see it in the increasingly younger playerbase, and in the features intoduced to babyproof what was once a solid, unforgiving survival game. Rocket integration was cool at first, but soon it became too accessible. EVERY server had teleports, and warps, and shops, and kits. Every server invaded by swarms of spawned APCs and Hinds. Workshop integration was cool at first, but it soon became very obvious that the easiest mods to make were vehicles and guns, which turned modded servers from something neat into unforgiving wastelands of nuclear rocket lauchers and 1 hit kill full-auto sniper rifles. The Hard and even Normal difficulties nearly ceased to exist in the server list as time went on, and if they did the servers were not populated. 3x loot became the norm, and when \"Unturned\" is searched on youtube, some of the top keywords associated with it are \"PvP\" and \"Raid\". Not a single mention of the word \"zombie\" or \"survival\" on the first page of results. We ruined the game.  If you've never played Unturned before, just wait for 4.0 or go back to 2.0."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Unturned is a great game that I feel is worth a play, this is what I would have said a few years ago at least. Unturned was once a fun survival game where you fought zombies and scavenged for resources. But I feel there was a turning point for this game soon after Russia was released as a map. I used to look forward to coming home to play on a unturned survival server and meet friendly new people that wanted to work together with me and have fun in unturned. Soon enough these servers disappeared, those friends became harder and harder to find. If you take a look at the server list you will see a long list of PVP, kits, command servers. Every server has become a raiding server based on PVP where if you die there is almost no consequence. The survival aspect of this game has been taken away from us, survival servers are a rarity that never lasts long before its place is taken by the new shiny no KOS role play server. Unturned I feel has lost its charm that it once possessed. Now all is left is a workshop filled with over powered machine guns that fire nukes for God's sake. Even after nearly 3 years and 1000 hours I cannot suggest unturned. It is not a bad game by any means but it is nowhere near what it once was or what it can be. I hope that 4.0 will act as a clean slate for the community and hopefully we can do better."},

It just isn't the game I fell in love with anymore, I remember how great 2.0 was and how, most people were peaceful and didn't just go around shooting people. Now though, EVERY server is about murder, there is no point in making a base as, anyone with a dragon fang and 2-3 trips to a military base, has more than enough ammo to completely raid any base you make, I actually CHALLENGE anyone who doesn't believe this to go make a base they think will be too hard to raid on a server, I GAURENTEE you in a day or two, it will be raided. All anyone does is murder people, it doesn't matter if you're naked and they are fully geared, if someone sees you and you don't kill them first, you're as good as dead. All servers are either pvp kits, or run by toxic little kids. It is absurd how bad this game has become, as the community is just so bad...I honestly hope Unturned 2 will redeem this game for me.

A few gripes that i've always had are one; the movement is janky, Zombies feel really bland when you have better weapons & Characters seem a bit to blocky for my liking. This was much more forgivable when the game was more focused on it's survival aspect because it was harder to get better weapons in the first place & players weren't really the focus If you enjoy PvP games then try Unturned out.

On the other hand, I am happy to say that I am actively reading comments and making any neccessary changes to the review. Please check back every so often! And don't even mention the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing crate unboxing garbage.  that was born on a browser game made for children called ROBLOX. Think garry's mod, but instead of physics manipulation you have zombie survival at its core. Some of the games on ROBLOX were actually fun back in the day when the popular developers weren't all cash milkers, such as the prototype of this game, and that is why I played it. That prototype eventually became this game that kept getting better. It is now in the 3rd stage of it's early access (Also called 3.0), and it is doing extremely well with a fully fledged workshop and excellent map editor.   This game, however, has the same problem ROBLOX did on all competitive modes: The damned community. You will constantly be shot or punched by random childish fresh spawns because they have nothing to lose. It's apparently funny for a few minutes? And fully geared people, mature or not, shoot on sight to avoid losing their hard work to people like this. Eventually it becomes a massive clusterf*ck; you have idiots with no gear or a gun with 20 bullets running around just to kill, and then fully geared people going on a sniping spree, some of which are forced to. Seemingly the childish community came here because they like Minecraft or watch PewDiePie. PewDiePie, like any other sh*tty spoiled youtuber, acts like a tard to make a profit and attracts so many children that flood any game that he reviews. Then comes the minecraft part. Is everything that has blocks or pixel graphics automatically minecraft? No. Why does any game that have those attract minecraft audiences? Because the children can't tell the difference. I mean, come on, this game doesn't even abide by a grid. Nelson seems to like it because it makes his game popular and everyone worships him. Children will bow down to a snail. I would rather have noone playing my game at all than to have this.  The only solution it seems is to play with your friends on a private server. Playing with your friends is fun. No KOS/Roleplay servers also tend to allow \"mugging\" which is basically taking people's\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665without killing them. It's just KOS in a disguise. Additionally, Hamachi and other portforwarders are prone to hacks and are insecure, so those are rarely a good idea unless you're playing with real-life friends.

There are many good youtubers which highlight alot of the best parts of what the game has, Building, Farming, Teamwork, and its fairshare of inside memes, and its dedicated base of players. For me, it was the reason I gave Unturned a try, and have fun and enjoy the best part of the game. Turns out of course, alot of the best part you see in video form are... well. Highly superficial. In this review I'll be using the popular study known as \"Bartles Taxonomy\" and really what I means to be a particual type of player trying to play against the games current designe. ----- I, as a player fall into a space between the Social/Explorer/Achiver player type, So I came into the game looking forward to getting to meet and work together with other player, getting to shape the world into a living social economy. I knew that there were other hostile players, but I had figured if talks fail guns would be the final resort.  I was mistaken, much like that game it is based off of, (Arma2:Dayz) Almost all servers play as follows, -Kill everyone who isn't your friend -Kill anyone within range -Kill any bambies you find at the spawns -If you see someone minding their own business, Kill them. -Kill your friends -Unfriend your friends -Call them salty and then Kill them again -Kill anyone being friendly with eachother. ... Yeah, I hope you see my point, Killer type players saturate this game down to its very mechanics, with near zero space for Socializing, Exploring, or Achieving anything within the game. Its just full of people who want to Kill, Steal, and take advantage of player whom are fundementally more vulnerable than them. This turned my enjoyment of the game sour very very quickly. In part I think it is due to the sheer amount of inbalance that exists within the map designes, and how players exprience eachother mechaniclly. ---Base Defence/Raiding--- If you are playing on a PvP server solo, my suggestion is. Don't Or if you do, know everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, about the map. As a solo player, you are working for and earning everything that you will own in game. Because of this, it is very to simply lose hours of work to a group. Because of the sheer toxicity its player base, they will ensure that rebuilding will be impossible, by breaking all your storage chests, all your doors, stealing all your tools, and despawning all your food and place spikes around your bed. Without the slightest decency to leave you with anything they don't care for or need.  As a solo player, you are far better off playing single player than you are investing anytime into server multiplayer. (unless you are the previously mentioned Killer type, or really love being heartlessly killed.) One of the biggest isses I was with raiding in its current form is, its simply far too easy to raid other bases. The main problems being; Freeform Objects, Weak building materials, \"Claim Flags\" being too expensive, and the Chainsaw. Attackers just have a little too much flexability in terms of raiding, Defending a small solo base with a makeshift rifle, against a team with explosives and military grade guns is frankly impossible. Whats worst is that, if Items actually has any value owning, raiding a fresh player would be pointless; on that note: Highlevel Items just... spawn, The people who own them never needed to work to earn them, no crafting or gathering required. it just spawns in a preset place in the world, and the killers who get them simply use them to terrorize other players who can't fight back. The Spawn/Loot system the game currently just makes it easy for Killer type players, They don't have to spend the time to earn their tools, they just grab it freely and murder then next player they see, Personally I think this is stupidly broken, that anyone can B-line to a military outpost and be immidiatly geared up to kill other people, --- My point is, this game in its current state and selection of maps ONLY caters to Killer type players, with the exceptions of the weird roleplayer server here and there, there is nothing in this game for the folks who want to play nice with strangers.  On these grounds alone, make the game very unfun for anyone but Groups and total psycopaths, and does nothing for any other type of players. The solution Id use would be to allow a space for more social interactions and lower the power gap between players, It way too easy to get your hands on a gun, and even easier to kill other players with it."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "This game was decent, it really was. But now its turned to something that nobody wants to play. This game is filled with little kids and the community is dead. Nelson needs to add LESS content and needs to add more QUALITY to his current content. PVP is practically stupid because all that matters is who has the best loot. Vehicles and bases are basically useless because they can easily be blown up/into. Clans of 18 year olds and groups of 12 year old pubescent  boys have taken over the servers. Speaking of servers none of the maps compliment the server space. 24 people for maps the size of germany and russia. Were is the risk in that. This game needs to have more quality than content. Fix your updates nelson, add more population slots to servers, fix vannilla, Make pvp more dangerous, and stop making vehicles and base maintence so a hastle. This will fix your game and make the community less toxic."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "The community is literally all 10 year old kids that can't afford monecraft so they look for any game that the characters are made out of blocks. I only ever like to play this game with a few friends and when I am really bored and because they are clueless 10 year olds its just too easy. Only fun part is to sneak up behind kids and scream through the mic so they freak out and get a jump scare then just shoot them at point blank and watch them cuss at you through the in game chat. The admins are probably worse then the general community because it just consists of kids hosting servers and totally just becoming the Kim Jon Un of video games. You do anything that they dont like and it consists of you getting banned or non stopped spawned in the same area and killed over and over. A lot of admins actually abuse their privlages in general to give themselves the best stuff and make themselves god mode and kill every one and whenyou call them out you get banned. I got on a server with some friends and we were just walking around and some F-ing spanish kid teleported me into a small town that was surrounded in barb wire and I couldnt get out and then they started talking to me in spanish but they never did anything I was just trapped there. I think its cool that a teenager made a game that was able to get on steam thats completly free with no pay to win but the community is one of the worst I have ever seen I also hosted one of my own servers before were I tried to be a good admin and I was having a conversation with people and then all of a sudden this kid comes up to me in game starts talking to me over the mic (he knows I was the admin) then he walks away and he seemed friendly. A few seconds later and he runs me over with a truck then gets out, starts tea bagging, me and cussing at me. No respect for admins at all. Honestly the best way to play is just make your own LAN server or normal server with a password and just have a few of your friend mess around on it. Public servers are aids."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "This is a review of the offline game.           This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over  25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests.            I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming.  \tI found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.  \tAfter I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought \"oh well\". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose.  \tI have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers. Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth. I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold. But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on. I get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale. But if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them. And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves. As a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one. An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh, and it's also pretty cheap."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers. Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.   But there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.   Now a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating. Then you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave. Months will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost. Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity. If you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game. 10/10 Masterpiece."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done! This game is like Crack!  I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc.  Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone. A few weeks later.  we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better. One week later.  Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls)  The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies.  The next day.  I log on. Everything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins.  Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....

That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game. 3 days later.  we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one.  But we we're determined and longing for revenge....  we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil. We started mass producing grenades. I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends.  Today,  we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least. Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others. Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language."},

Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc. Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one. Make no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen. In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour.  For me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team. That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release). In all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine."},

There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play. I'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.

Like why duh fug is it 108gb? even when it only downloads 30 it still allocates 108gb from my drive. And I have 100's of games. Used to be 200's until I wanted ARK back. BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME 1.) Change inventory keybinding to Tab. Make console \"~\" Plays off very fluent. 2.) 5,000+ Negative reviews about optimization, You need more than just a great graphics card. This game is more CPU          dependant, I'm using an old 550gtx card and runs pretty smooth and with custom video settings it looks just fine. Tweak with everything for a few minutes, you'll find a good enjoyable setting. Unless you're running an old IBM pc. (lol) 3.) Note that you can customize your character down to hand size, male/female, etc. My only downside is somehow I still look the same as everyone. OFF TO THE GAMEPLAY 1.) Unique inventory system, you have a mysterious impant in your hand which is the HUD for everything. You learn how to craft everything without a single blueprint through engrams, which better items require certain higher level. There are blueprints to find for a shortcut, but you never Really need them. EDIT: Blueprints can be BETTER than just the original engram I.E higher armor or durability. Survival is basic eat/drink over time it decays like rust, etc. 2.) Supply Drops, (I assume everyone is a test subject sent to this planet and these drops are hi tech packages warped to the land by the Army/Scientist) are also unique rather than a box that falls from a random helicopter. They are level restricted from level 5 to level 45 (so far I've seen). Can drop nearly anything in the game. I.E. Level 5 drop gave me an entire 1 square house, door and all. Drops have a cool and unique item model and the way drops work is just sci-fi-ish and refreshing. 3.) Crafting is Very seamless, pretty much a basic system though, which works just fine for replayablity. Repairs are on the spot until you get better items then you'll use the Smithy. You can refine items so they won't break when you level higher. 4.) Weather system/Temperature is neat. You get hot and cold, leading to burning or freezing to death after a long while. So far I've only seen rain and heavy fog as far as precipitaion. Hopefully while server days pass and development continues We will see snow and disasters such as tornados, typhoons, etc. 5.) Combat. Let's be frank. Task Manager Says is all under processes = \"Shooter Game\" Basic swing and strike for melee. Iron sights for ranged. Online combat is sketchy due to ping. But Singleplayer/Local is very solid. There are multiple weapon attachments as well.  6.) Physics in the game are great, due to Unreal 4. But I will ADD THE FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. At first I died nearly encumbered falling from maybe a 3 meter drop (thinking, oh I had alot on me it would hurt more). Only to die off the same drop being naked to get my gear back. So water, landscapes, foliage, all great. But FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED.  7.) Dinosaurs (they are currently adding a multitude of species). Right now there are maybe a dozen different dinos and animals. Like a sabertooth tiger, mammoth, sharks etc. All very well produced and modeled. Sometimes pathing is a little bad, I kill T-Rex's and Bronto just because they get stuck in trees or up a mountain side. Other than that, all dinos attack as they should and look great doing so. The taming method is very tedious, but unique. If you USE a nonlethal weapon on a dino they will go unconsious, which will have a meter telling you how long, and also a meter bar for taming. You simply place the food in their \"inventory\" wait and protect. Simple yet tedious. Making saddles are level required as well. (i'm to the point in local-play to just \"~ ForceTame\") 8.) Building is best described as rust or h1z1. Simple place foundation and addon. Yet there are alot of extra things you can do, such as catwalks, ladders, water pipes to transport a water source 17423 miles away. Also pipes can help you find your way around areas (I used some as placements and arrows). There is a modern aspect to building as well. Such as air conditioners, refridgerators, lamps, turrets, all need to be powered by generator and electrical wires. So that's a grade A move, on my part. Also if you play online just simply beware, this is a survival game. Meaning people are psycho. 9.) Finally last and foremost, you can defecate,\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 poop, take a number two, talk to a horse named john, pop a squat, and pick it right up to fertilize your crops (which is VERY nessecary in my case) SO OVERALL This game is still in development, it does have it's lower qualities, which I mentioned. BUT, I can see why this game is coming to my Xbox One and PS4, rather than Rust, Dayz (never happening), H1Z1 (who is really gunna play that?), or many other survival games. It is simply because this game has all of the qualities of a AAA game and showed them to a playable extent, which companies like Steam, Sony, and Microsoft will gladly support. And for people who have not been able to play the game. Buy it on your Next Gen console because \"PC master race, right?\"  Thanks to anyone who reads this long a$$ review. I've enjoyed the game, killed Broodmother and now resting as a humble Turok. I do think you should try it out before it is bought out by the $60 greedy game publishers. It is fooking worth it."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "After a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game. First off the game looks realy nice, no way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so far, some bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them. A few highlight of my gameplay Woke up on a beach and started to get the feel of the game and controls. Looking around  i saw another player working his way  thoward the forest and i tough: hey ill stalk him and see what hes up to. a few 100 meters into the dence forest he gets attacked by what i think was a Trex feeling for a snack. i didnt stay to check what happend to the guy, i legged back to the beach where i woke up.  Next few hours i was working my hardest just to get though the nights without falling to the smaller reptiles prowling the beach. Though to myself after makeing a spear, fish should be easy food to catch, I swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeper, spotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars.... I spend a cold night out on that rock. Working my way north along the shoreline looking for a good spot to call home i came across a dino that was left for dead that i decided to tamed. Over a period of 3 ingame days and nights feeding it and defending it and me the entire time. Gathering berries and makeing a campfire to cook myslef some meat and for light for the night times. After 3 long night and days he finaly woke up and i had my first companion. For a time all was well i was building the house on a hill loverlooking the shore, My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido.  Would i recomend to buy it? Hell yes :)"},

You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. \"THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,\" he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. \"Gank him,\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665!\" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering \"GG 2 EZ\", and your family sits in the living room muttering \"garbage team\" and \"reported\". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try. 10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "I have over 200 hours into the game, compared to a lot of ARK players i'm still a noob so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job, don't even bother thinking about getting this game. I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7.  First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game. Pro tip, don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible. 1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game. 2.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.)  3.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.) 4.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them. 5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1.) 6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear, you don't get to save any of your dinos, you don't even get to fight back, it's all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers. 7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on \"their\" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn't tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also, if you\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to. 8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have. 9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD! 10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try, you won't.  Look, I'm tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it, not like you'd have a chance if you were. EDIT: I never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about. Firstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob, especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe, because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone. 1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base. 2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things."},

Even after the producers put out its final DLC which was so unfinished and full of bugs and glitches, you would think that they would take a step back and fix its past 3 DLCs which they have ignored. What do they do when they cant push new content on Ark? Make a new game. I love this game, very toxic community as you would guess aswell, but even worse developers.

{"recommended": false, "review": "At the time I write this, I have put about 3500 hours into this game. I have been playing it for over a year now and have had a lot of ups and downs. I play on a PvP server and I have had everything I had taken from me and all my tames killed many times. I have worked my way back up over and over and have managed to secure my tribe as a beta tribe on a server and am in an alliance with the alpha tribe. Then Wild Card dropped Scortched Earth and the ability to transfer players and items into the server I play on. My server did everything we could to protect ourselves and it paid off. Then Wild Card made all the supply drops not effected by structures so they would still drop. So, we blocked them all off with vaults. Now Wild Card made it so the drops land on top of anything under them. We don't have any defense against that. Why are we worried? Because for the better part of the last year, many servers have been taken over completely my mega tribes. Tribes that regularly hit server cap with who plays on the server. Who farm servers of all their resources and have been unchecked because no one could farm enough resources to fight them on their own servers. Now that they can travel from server to server, they are slowly working their way through all official servers and wiping the servers of everything. For people like myself who have dumped litterally thousands of hours into this game, we are doing all we can to defend, but we can only do so much as we can't be online all day everyday. With the servers not being region locked, we have Chinese, Russian, and Australian tribes coming to our server during peak times for them, but the early morning hours for us. Meaning, we have no one on to defend what we worked hard to make. We now have to work in shifts, like it is a job, to defend what we have, all because Wild Card decided to open the arks up and have the players wipe the servers for them. When a large server falls, most of the players quit playing the game. They move onto something else. That is good for Wild Card, because then the servers become low population, so they can repurpose them or remove them and that saves them a lot of money. They already made all they will make off of the players currently playing. So, if they remove us, they can save on server costs and use that for more advertising to get more unsuspecting players into the game. Overall, Wild Card doesn't listen to their players unless those players are praising how great the game is. The players that riducule the game, are ignored or banned due to rule violations. Wild Card doesn't know what they are doing in terms of making a game that isn't completely broken nor do they know how to have a conversation with their player base that isn't just the positive things about the game. They refuse to hear or even acknowledge there is anything wrong with their game and that is a huge problem. Bottom line, only get this game if you're going to play on unofficial servers or you like logging in and finding that everything you have is gone, yet again, and you get to punch a tree and start over. ADDED February 02, 2017: I mainly talked about the PvP on Official servers in the review above, so I am adding the other ways to play the game here to hopefully give a more well rounded review. Single Player is nice as well, but nothing is persistant. So you need to increase a lot of rates in single player to make it fun. Like, at stock, if taming something takes 6 hours, you need to be logged into the game for 6 hours to tame it. If you exit, that timer pauses. Breeding anything becomes too cumbersome without increasing rates because 4 real life days that pauses when you exit the day is just not possible. Unless you want it taking 2 weeks to raise one thing. I just use single player as a \"creative mode\" to spawn everything in and build to see what I would need for the server I actually play on. PvE is enjoyable but frustrating in a different way. You can't build near others and as long as you close your doors, no one can take your things. People can annoy you and get in your way and just be asshats to you, and you can't do anything to them because you can't fight them. They can build walls around your base at the build limit so you can't get out or in. It's like the 12 year olds at malls that will be annoying little \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and and when you tell them to quit being \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, they try to egg you on by telling you that you can't do anything because they are a minor and you can't hit them. Just really disrespectful. In some cases it's worse than PvP. The unofficial servers are nice as it's less \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s and more good players. Though, then you run the risk of the admins of the servers spawning in whatever they want and wiping the server anytime without notice. So, you could log in and the whole server is wiped and you lost everything. They could change up the mods on the server without notice and just shut the server down because they didn't want to pay for it anymore. If you're playing PvP on their server and you wipe them and become alpha, they can just delete everything you have, rollback the server to before you wiped them, spawn in a level 1million titanosaur and smash everything you have, or any combination of those. My biggest gripe with the game is that it's not fun anymore. It was fun for the last year and with the last few months of updates, it's just not fun anymore. You can have a lot of fun on unofficial servers, but they are also very volatile as well. Maybe more so than PvP official servers. The way I see it, is that if you never played this game before and you join a server, you should have fun right away. You shouldn't have to join unofficial servers and add mods to the game to make it fun. To me, that says the developers failed at their job for making a fun game. Sure, int he future, you might get bored of the offical servers and mod the game to get some NEW excitement out of it, but you shouldn't have to mod a game after you bought it in order to get fun from it. If Wild Card wants to keep all transfers open the way they have it now when you can transfer creatures, players, and items from server to server, then I suggest they do a full wipe of every server so everyone has a fair start to build up. Otherwise the mega tribes that basically own official servers have so much unchecked power to just wipe servers and take all their resources and get even bigger. There isn't any hope to fight them off. But, if Wild Card just limits you transferring your character, that would be better as then you need to build up on a server. I have seen a few smaller tribes band together and wipe alphas that are just mean and ruin your day for fun. It happened on my server last year. The alpha we have now is friendly and helps the server anytime they can and uses their power to defend the server against attacks. EDIT: I haven't edited anything on this review. I just wanted to add that I replied in the comments to reply to the comments I received about this review. EDIT 2: I still haven't changed my initial review, just wanted to add two things that I know no one will read. 1.

They are all alive, but very toxic, hateful people and I don't talk to them unless I absolutely need to. 2. Since I posted this, I keep getting friend request from people. I'm denying every single one of them because I'm just assuming you are all trolls going to harrass me or come to my server and wipe it. Though, that would speed up the process of me quitting the game as I wouldn't have anything left to go back to. EDIT 3: I added into the main review about the other game modes so people would stop commenting about them. But, none of them will actually read the review and just call me names and say I don't have a life. Which says a lot about them."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Would only suggest buying this game if it is on sale and you have friends to play with on a private server. Never, ever play any of the official severs. The veteran players have made them virtually unplayable for new players. Entered an official PvE server, was instantly killed by a level 75 Raptor as I was spawning into one of the low level spawn points (probably from a veteran player kiting it there). Spawned at a different low level spawn and couldn't even build the basic campfire because all of the veteran players set up pillars everywhere to prevent others from placing any building pieces down as they can't be destroyed on a PvE server. Spent most of the time trying not to starve to death because the only food I could harvest was berries, and berries do so little to fill your food meter that you are basically eating them like you were stuffing your face in a food eating competition. Whenever you do die (and it will happen allot), you can sometimes respawn inside other players' houses. When that happens the only thing you can do is wish for the sweet release of death as you slowly starve, trapped in a building where all the doors are locked, the walls are invincible, and no one is online to let you out. Tried spawning in higher level zones in hopes of getting out of the no-build areas the veterans placed everywhere, but found out that the veterans claimed those areas same as the starting zones. Tried running to one of the Obelisks so that I could transfer my progress to a different PvE server in hopes of finding one not so stuffed, but the Veteran players bascially built giant FU walls around them to prevent anyone that didn't have a flying mount from reaching them. Started a new character on a different official PvE server and the exact same problems came up again. Switching to a PvP server fixed the problem of invincible pillars everywhere preventing new players from progressing through the building tree. But griefing is the passtime of all the veteran players on PvP servers as they have nothing left to do since it is impossible for anyone to topple an Alpha Tribe. Tried playing on a small tribes official server, but the griefing is still there. Instead of dozens of players griefing you, there is only 3-6 at a time. Got to about level 62 on a small tribes server, and the entire time I was playing I was constantly being reset back to nothing as the veteran players would C4 the hell out of my house, kill all of my tames, and then constantly keep me sedated for hours on end while they played around with my uncouscious body. Whenever they got tired of playing with me (usually the next day as I would get bored of being kept in a vegitative state and log off for the day), I would have to respawn at a starting point and have to redo 6+ hours of work. I'm level 62, I should be working towards stuff like turret entrenched metal houses, crafting powerful gear, and taming strong dinos. But instead I'm spending most of my time trying to rebuild the stone raft house that gets demolished every other day. I even looked up a tutorial on how to build properly, and that still doesn't stop someone from dropping a bunch of C4 on your house and destroying it for the laughs while simultaneously mocking the low level player trying to play the game in global chat. The people at the top are constantly kicking the people at the bottom, preventing them from getting to a position to where they can actually pose a threat and provide interesting gameplay to veterans. As a result of this, the game turns into a fulltime job where you don't get paid, you don't get any work done, prospects for promotion are grim, and everyone you work with act like jerks 24/7. The \"get gud\" argument can't applied here simply because there is no level playing field with how the progression system is set up. I would dare anyone who says \"get gud\" to take on a fully outfitted level 105 veteran, butt naked, with nothing but the starting tools. Do that and win consistently, and I would conceed that I need to \"get gud\". Diseases in this game are unnecessarily brutal, especially if you get one at the start. On the small tribes PvP server that I played, I got infected with Swamp Fever in one of the starting zones within the first few hours of play. Wasn't even sure what was happening until I noticed that my stats were all wrong. As it turns out, diseases stick with your character, even through death. And the only way to cure it is to either make an antidote that requires materials deep in territories packed with predators (and high level players), or transfer to another server to wipe the disease. So I had the choice of either making a brand new character and losing all my progress, transfer my character to another server and then spend hours trying to reach another Obelisk and hope no one would raid my stuff while I was gone, or be gimped until I got to the point where I could take on those higher level players. Lets just say that I chose poorly in that regard (not that any of the choices were anything that should be considered acceptable for new players). What's even scarier is that as I was researching how to cure the disease, I found out that veteran players could use the diseases in a sort of biological warfare against new players. It's apparently possible to infect tamed Dodos and leave them in the starting zones. The amount of griefing tools that the Devs give veterans is just daunting to me. It's like they want to encourage the toxicity to new heights. Supposedly, some have said unofficial servers will fix these issues. But with the ability of the server owner to become God incarnet in a game that is designed to encourage griefing at every opportunity, I don't have much hope for that making the game better. Most of my encounters with people in the game have been negative on both PvE and PvP servers as the veteran community is rife with toxicity. Out of all of them, I've only met one veteran who was actually nice to me. I did play on a private server with a friend, and while the world felt a little empty with only two players in it, the survival aspects of the game can be pretty compelling. The game can be rather brutal at times if you happen to wander into a higher level zone before you are ready. But the moment you manage to get a good dinosaur buddy and manage to keep it alive, the gameplay opens up quite a bit. Just remember to take things slow in the beginning and not wander too far from the starting zones. Base building can be rather clunky and far too restrictive at times. The sloping landscape restricts allot of what you can do and only being able to build new parts parallel or perpendicular to each other will often result in most of the stuff you build looking rather boxy. Sometimes the piece you try to place down is spasming around different snap points like an epileptic at a rave as it tries to decide where it wants to go, and the only choice you have is to drop it and hope for the best. If it is placed wrong, you have to quickly pick it back up otherwise you lose half of the materials when you demolish it (rather steep price for a game with such clunky building mechanics if you ask me). Other times, a piece that looks like it is going in the spot you want snaps either in a wrong orientation or completely different snap point from the one you were looking at. I probably spent about 80% of my time building fighting the poorly designed snap mechanics. I can't help but feel that the building mechanics would be better served if the developers looked at games like Space Engineers where they allow you to easily rotate blocks on a grid. If the developers could find a way to prevent veteran players from ruining the experience for new players, this game could be great. Unfortunately, right now, the game is mediocre at best and isn't worth the high price tag so long as the veteran players remain as the gatekeepers to the most compelling parts of the gameplay."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "First off. I know people are going to read this and go \"You have 1.5k HOURS IN THIS GAME HOW CAN YOU GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW?\" Easy. I've played the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of this game. I love it. I split the time playing it between myself and a family member. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing.  The difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It's immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you're mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you'll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who's hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you've spent HOURS taming can be gone. It's infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won't get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it's difficult. It's unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself. Why can't I recommend this game? It's broken. I've been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked. Some of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors  are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you're stun locked for 10 seconds. It's hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are. Constant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you're breaking something within the game. It doesn't necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it's small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it's unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time.  Stuff like this shouldn't be happening to a game that's out of Early Access.  Quite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn't have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It's understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title.  For that reason, and that reason alone. I cannot recommend that others buy this game. Not until Wildcard fixes some of the glaring stability issues that it has."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Loved this game. At first it's a blast! But then you realize that the boss fights take literally months on end to prepare for and the only viable strategy is simply lots of t rexes, a pig and a yutyrannus. As difficulty increases you simply get better saddles and more riders because all thay changes is the bosses hp. Endgame is incredibly disappointing.  On official pve servers people constantly build spawn traps preventing you from doing anything. If you report them the staff does nothing about this even tho it is outlined in the code of conduct.  Players from foreign countries harass servers constantly and block off resources/wyvern egg spawn etc. So they can farm them and sell them for money on websites, again I have seen them do nothing about this.  You will get stuck... allot and have no way to kill yourself or get out because you are stuck in free fall until you starve to death. My friend couldn't play because his game literally would crash every 5 minutes. My game upon loading up and trying to join a server forces itself to restart each time, the restarted client will then actually join the server. This game is great fun. But there are so many glitches and they allow so many people to abuse game mechanics on \"official\" servers. If you submit a ticket because any issue good luck on getting a response, good luck on actually completing the ticket even as it is made difficult even to request help.  Great concept, and fun game but them allowing people to violate their code of conduct and not fixing the issues is tiresome."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "A game with monumental potential but is plagued with many flaws. The gameplay is fantastic, the complete freedom is refreshing and unique. You can have hours & hours of fun in this massive open world with so many ways to play the game.  However, the official servers are a joke, not just in how they run, but the pvp gameplay promotes a toxicity amongst the community, tribes are forced to be more aggressive and cautious because they can lose so much if they are raided by other players. This is where the problems start. Smaller, casual tribes struggle to get to a position to enjoy a PvP server as they get wiped by Tribes with thousands of hours of grinding gameplay. At end game, tribes start going to the extremes trying to DdoS servers, duplicate items, slot cap servers all to get this extra edge and quite literally destroy the game for everyone else. The game is so dependant on the grind, that you can't stop playing without understanding that if you log on in a week you, your base & your dinos will be gone.  Trying to find a place to build on PvE servers where someone hasn't made a foundation & pillar to not allow you build around there is annoying. Then once you finally start building on one of these PvE official servers and try and tame your first dino, it won't let you because the server is dino capped! I know there are some fantastic unofficial servers out there, but do I really want to invest all my time into a server that can be turned off, changed or wiped?  - I would love to see a auto toggle PvE - PvP feature. Just to give enough time for new players and casuals to get on their feet, understand essential game mechanics and will auto toggle when your tribes resources, dinos and members reach a certain point - New servers that have tribe based Dino & resource caps, might promote a different style of strategic and skill based gameplay. A casual, faster paced experience with less investment might bring in new players and provide variety to the normal ark game modes. - Something has to be done about people placing random structures all over the place in PVE so no one can build remotely close to them. I have seen some span ridiculously far...  Perhaps making it that you can't build near anything bigger than a 3x3? Instead of a foundation & pillar?"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "I'll start by stating that as of the time of writing this review, I have 3507 hours in this game.  Those hours are mostly on official servers, but a lot of them are also on dedicated/private/modded servers.  With that many hours, it should be clear to anyone that I liked this game and that there must be something within it that has made me put so much time into it, right?  Right.  Kind of, at least. The basics of the game are fantastic.  You start out incredibly weak and can become incredibly strong.  You can do this on official servers.  You can do this on dedicated and private servers.  And if you are really bored, you can do this in single player mode.  The maps are large and fun.  The gameplay is exciting.  Reaching almost any goal feels rewarding and compels you to keep going.  You never run out of things to do.  You can always farm materials, tame dinosaurs, raid a base, defend against someone raiding your base, and the list goes on and on.  This is - without a doubt - one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  But... The truth is, I think that I convinced myself that this game was great.  It isn't.  After all of the incredibly time consuming tasks you perform in this game, so many things can - and very likely will - happen that set you back or even make you start completely over, it's ridiculous.  Let me explain. That dino that took you hours to tame (no exaggeration here) and that somehow made it through without being attacked by another player or some random dino biting it or stomping on it as it passed by?  It came out perfect!  It's the best dino you have ever tamed.  It's the best dino on the server!  It's the best dino in the history of the game!  Well, it can get stuck in a wall.  It can get stuck in the ground.  It can fall through the map.  Can you get it replaced?  Nope!  Well, sort of.  You can put a ticket in for it and three(ish) weeks later, a game dev will contact you and make you set up an appointment with them to give you a replacement.  Depending on when your mutual schedules align, this can take even more time.  When it finally happens, the replacement will not be exact.  It's almost certain that whatever the replacement is will be very far from what you actually lost.  There is no \"restore\" for this.  The game dev will simply \"spawn\" in the same type of dino - up to a certain level only - and tame it for you.  The stats are random so the liklihood of you getting anything that you actually care about is very very low.  Will they keep doing it until it matches what you had before?  Nope.  They do it once then they are done and then they are gone, ignoring anything that you say to them as they float, naked, up and away from you.  Good thing you waited weeks for that, right? How about that character that you created and leveled for countless hours.  You beat end game bosses, unlocking the best engrams/skills in the game.  You gained extra levels above the soft level cap for it.  Well, somehow it got lost/corrupted/deleted by something outside of your control.  No worries.  That can be restored by submitting a ticket, right?  Well - no.  Very similar to the situation explained above, they cannot simply restore your character.  They will only have you create a new character and level it up to the soft cap for you.  You don't get your boss kills.  You don't get your engrams/skills unlocked.  You don't get those ascended levels back.  You get to go do all of that again.  Too bad for you!  At least they make a funny noise while floating away again.  That's hilarious! Did you find a video of a cool place to build?  Did you go from server to server and look for a that same place only to find it built in and then finally get to one server where it was open?  Nice!  Well, after all the time you put into that, guess what.  You can log in one day and every single thing is gone.  You didn't get raided.  There is nothing in your tribe log showing that anything was destroyed or killed.  It's just all gone.  Everything.  Every dino, every floor, every door, every item.  Poof.  Well, it just so happens that a dev can simply come into the server and delete every single thing that your tribe has.  Dinos, structures, items.  All of it.  They don't give you a warning.  They don't even give you an explanation.  You just log in and it's all gone and you have to question everyone on the server as to what happened.  When you do finally see someone else getting an \"explanation\" of what happened, the dev simply states that the being able to build in that area is \"unintended\" and is considered to be the same thing as undermeshing (building or going inside of the terrain).  Not undermeshing, but considered to be the same thing?  Oh, so there must be a list of places that building is not acceptable, right?  Nope.  You get to figure that out on your own.  Wahooooo!   Do you like lag?  Well, you're in luck.  This game is one of the most lag-ridden games I have ever played.  Can they fix it?  Who knows!  It's been years and it's still there - taunting you at the best times.  Like when you are shooting at a dino or at another player.  When you are just about to use a parachute.  When you dive that Griffin down into the scar to get some speed so that you can get away with that 190 Wyvern egg that you just stole.  Uh oh! - lag spike!  You missed that last shot on the dino or player and got killed instead.  Your parachute didn't deploy and you smashed into the ground.  Your Griffin didn't get the memo that you looked upwards to get away and instead, it flew straight into the lava - instantly killing you and the Griffin and destroying your gear and that 190 Wyvern egg.  Too bad, the lag is just part of the game! LOLOL!  Weeeeeeee! Did your base get raided by someone that DID actualy undermesh to do it while you were offline?  Guess you didn't record that, then right?  Well, too bad for you and hooray for them being able to take all of your stuff and keep it!  HAHA!  GOTTEM! So many times, I saw things like these happen to others and thought \"Wow, I don't have those issues\".  Well, eventually your luck runs out.  I've had every one of those things - and others - happen and I have screenshots and ticket dialogue that show all of it. I love(ed) this game.  I think anyone that plays it would likely agree that it's one of the best games they have played - until you are the victim of any number of the issues that they don't fix or that Wildcard Studios unfairly does to it's loyal players.  It is incredibly unfortunate that this game is the best in the genre (in my opinion) and has nothing to really compete with it.  Because of this, it seems that there is nothing that drives Wildcard Studios to fix the plethora of issues within the game.  There are so many, it's ridiculous.  There is nothing stopping their game devs from abusing their power and deleting everything you have done with no warning or explanation.  They don't back up your data at all.  Restores for anything are impossible.  What kind of business is this?  Instead of Wildcard Studios releasing more content with the same issues or instead of re-skinning dinos or making new colors available, they should try fixing some - or even one - of the issues, instead. I used to tell everyone looking for a game to play to buy this one.  That was selfish of me.  To all of those that I wronged, I apologize.  If you haven't bought this already - I would say don't waste your time/money. Yours Truly, A Teamer"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "The truth about NewZ So, you guys are wondering who are the creators of this meme right? Fredaikis is a Swedish guy who comes from a shady background, this guy has been releasing cheating tools for games like Infestation Survivor Stories, Counter Strike : Global Offensive and so long, in short for too long he has been ruining the things that we all love and we all paid for. Later, the full source code for both client and server for Infestation was released, the game was dying and Fredaikis was part of the reason why, and he knew it. He saw a business opportunity here and released NewZ. But he wasn't happy with his community, it was still too small. His only option was to ruin all his competition, hence he started releasing cheating tools for all the competing emulators, while keeping his own protected from said tools. This ruined dozens of Infestation emulators, but with the fan base the game had, some were not yet done with it, hence NewZ started to grow. Hammerpoint Interactive, who has been a controversial company from the beginning, was taking a huge hit in their income and they eventually started cutting on their investments for servers, Infestation Survivor Stories is dead by now, just with a few dozen servers in North America. Players have been scammed all around. The game was removed from Steam for blatant false advertisement, its name was taken down on copyright grounds against World War Z trademark owners, they blatantly stole artwork from AMC's The Walking Dead, didn't even bother hiring a lawyer to write their software Terms of Service, so they just copy pasted from Riot Games' League of Legend and were caught doing so once again, not to mention all their shameful community interactions, ranging from Sergey Titov calling \"\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s\" to its players on his own public forum. Thankfully I have gotten my refund from Hammerpoint, so I have nothing really against them, but I know many people who fallen for this scam since shortly after I've gotten my refund they stopped issuing them and never gotten their money back. Anyway, Hammerpoint was still not done juicing this rushed copied concept of theirs, they've sold the rights to distributing their game to Fredaikis after seeing no other option to keep profiting from their software, they've literally given out their game to some teenager who ruined theirs. Fredaikis founded Fredaikis AB and now is distributing Infestation: New Z, yet he hasn't stopped its illegal practises and is still breaking every Intellectual Propriety protection law copying textures from Valve's Counter Strike Global Offensive amongst other equally serious offences. Yet and anyway I believe you fanboys won't believe half of this probably, to you Fredaikis is just some kind of saviour, when in fact he's nothing but a nasty teenager criminal and should be stopped at all cost, here's some proof to you guys.  <- Here we can see this steam account of his linked to the Greenlight item he submitted to steam.  <- Here we can see that account has a VAC ban, but it gets funnier :)  <- Quick search for his name on Google, here's a post he makes on a cheating forum publishing a tool that has ruined Hammerpoint Interactive's Infestation Survivor Stories, thousands upon thousands of people have downloaded this.  <- Over 39000 people have downloaded JUST his latest version of this tool, hundreds of thousands more have downloaded his previous versions all combined, if the number doesn't reach over a million. Now you can see why there were so many cheaters on Infestation.   <- But he was not done yet. No. He had to ruin his competition at all, getting all people to play NewZ :)  <- But wait, he still had to try to ruin Counter Strike:Global Offensive didn't he? Shameless prick........

{"recommended": false, "review": "Since original 'review' of this game was blown out of proportion and even members of developing team commented on it, I felt it was more than needed for me to really check out Infestation: The New Z to make sure thumbs down is the proper grade for this title. When I wrote the original review (scroll to the bottom to read it), I didn't play The New Z, but played the game that The New Z replaced in Steam's library and hence got its ID. Which one it was, I don't know. Waiting for DayZ (oh, how the kings have fallen), I was one of the many buyers of The War Z and also one of the many who refunded the game. I didn't do it because of false advertising which was the main reason why Steam approved refunds, but of constant bugs, glitches and bad optimization. It was simply a bad game, no matter its status (I think it was alpha back then). After The War Z came Infestation: Survivor Stories. It failed horribly. After that one came 'spiritual succesor' (Insert Michael Scott's NO GIF) Romero's Aftermath which I've downloaded because of, well yes, George A. Romero who's work I deeply respect and appreciate. I don't know if any other games came after that one, but the latest one, The New Z, appeared on my Steam store's frontpage a few days ago. And the reson why I wrote negative review instantly is because it looked suspiciously similar to previous titles.  I've clicked, as I always click on any zombie FPS with survival tag. I am still looking for the perfect one, after years and years of purchasing and trying out mediocre, if not terrible products that simply fail to deliver the fun mixture between realism and FPS chaos. Unfortunately, most of survival titles on Steam are nothing more than wagons on the hype train, except few notable exceptions (I am looking at you, The Long Dark, Subnautica and The Forest). The New Z is marked as ultimate free-to-play experience, combining three closely related genres into one: battle royale, survival and open world. Let's start with the best one, at least in my own not so humble opinion. Survival is slow paced horror of surviving days and night in hostile environment. Resources are scarce, zombies are many and mainly located around loot areas and community is almost completely comprised of soloists who kill on sight. I've been trying to find players to join group for hours and only twice people responded and added me to their group. Playing this mode in the long run proved non-productive because at the end, you'll be starving and unless you have free bus ticket or can afford pricey one (more about it later), you may leave yourself stranded away from any potential food and water source. Strength in numbers, so if you don't have any friends, be prepared for much more difficult journey. The New Z fails grouping the players just as other similar games simply because their zombies are not dangerous enough, they don't present a serious threat to solo players, even unarmed ones. Survival map is huge and it takes a lot to travel it on foot. There are small stashes of resources scattered around the map which are not marked on the map, so exploring can be rewarding, but make sure you're prepared. My favorite part of the day was dusk turning into a night.  If you get tired of surviving and need to take a break, there are several safe zones marked on the map. Here, there's no shooting and you can leave your extra stuff in the vault, so it waits for you when you come back or in case you die. Next to these are bus stations which are really useful for fast travel, but once you're out of free tickets, you either need to relay on buying bus tickets or getting premium account (more about that later) which allows for free bus transport.  Open World is PVP oriented mode. Smaller maps, more aggressive and diverse zombie types (huge one, fast one, lots of classic ones) and numerous loot instances. Here it's all about kill or be killed and your round will finish much earlier than expected, especially if you're not precise with your weapons.  Battle Royale, one of the selling points of this free-to-play game was something I couldn't try at all because of technical problems most players encounter, a black screen upon entering the server. Game starts with players gathering in the lobby and shooting each other relentlessly until the countdown begins. It is 100 player game, but most players I had on server was around 40. Unfortunately, after the countdown ends and real royale begins, my screen went black. Changing graphic details never did anything, so I cannot judge this mode, but I have to say I didn't get a chance to play it at all.  Judging from my previous experiences, The New Z is plagues by the same technical problems and glitches as its predecessors. There are a lot of getting stuck glitches and fall damage glitches. I've encountered a few sound glitches as well. The biggest problem were the same, clumsy zombie animations. Zombie combat isn't really revolutionary - you aim for the head, unless you have a melee weapon, then you aim for the weapon and move back and forth, trying to calculate when the next swing of zombie arms will happen. Zombies are sometimes hit during their hit animations, so it resets and drops a few frames of the next one, landing you a hit when you don't expect one.  The biggest problem of The New Z is its microtransactions, which make The New Z more of a freemium game than anything else. Beside normal, free accounts, you have a chance to purchase different tiers of premium accounts with different perks, ranging from smallest, priced at around 2,60 \u20ac per month (pretty much useless), up to lifetime premium priced 200 \u20ac. Beside that you get to buy Game Coins, a premium value that's being used for almost everything in the game. I am type of player who can play the game without purchasing anything and still have fun, but I do have a problem with this business practice. Some of it is pretty ridiculous, you need to pay for private servers, skinboxes are overpriced (any let's be honest, some of these skins are DAMN UGLY) and you can even pay to reset player timer (when your character dies, a certain amount of time needs to pass so you can use the player again). I'm on the fence about player progression system presented in the game. You can use XP points gained by killing to upgrade your character's stats. It gives a certain amount of depth to the game, but on the other hand, advantages gained can present a huge problems for up and coming players. In terms of Dungeons & Dragons alignment system, if The War Z and it's successors were chaotic evil characters, The New Z is chaotic neutral; D'n'D Player's Handbook states that chaotic neutral characters 'promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first; good and evil come second to their need to be free', meaning although The New Z is being promoted as free-to-play title, you will in the process lose either money (buying stuff) or time (surival games are interesting, but without truly deep system and some goals, ultimately pointless), and let's not even start talking about your nerves when you drop dead because of game bugs and glitches. In the oversatured market of bad zombie survival FPS/TPS shooter games (minus Miscreated, I haven't played it yet), The New Z may be the king, but the one eyed in the land of the blind. And that's not something to be proud of.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: So basically, it's the \"brand new\" game that I've somehow miraculously already played without even knowing about it.  Just seeing models, menus and FONT gives me idea this is one of million of WarZ, Infestation, Romero's Aftermath, what's-the-latest-name-for-it clones pumped up on microtransactions, ready to be shut down at certain point and replaced with the next one.  Steam should really get this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665sorted, I prefer having idiotic visual novels swarm all over Steam's store page over this. NO.  NO. NO. NO. NO."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Tl:dr    7/10 The game is fun but challenging. /*  *  As a quick edit, I have only played the open world game mode. *  I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  */  The game isn't easy. My experience with it has been about what I expected, and since so many reviews aren't very helpful, I will try to be.  1. Community is what you'd expect from any game like this. -Pros will kill you for the can of soda you picked up a second prior. -Noobs will kill you on sight to level up their characters. -Everyone else either wants to team, or collect items for their global storage. 2. Game play is different than most games I have played. -There is a global storage system that allows players to go into a server with an arsenal they like or have previously survived with. -You can make groups with friends or clans to work together against others or solo it and still be just as effective. -Super zombies will relentlessly chase you if they are aggroed and unprepared players will die every time. -Upon death you drop all items and are forceably removed from the server. Then you must either pay in game currency to wind down the timer, or simply wait a few minutes to respawn. To bypass this entirely, you could make multiple characters. -Upon spawning back in it is possible to find your dropped items, but getting to them before another player does is unlikely. 3. In game currency. -there are two types of ingame currency: real money and zombie money. While probably not their actual names, zombie money is obtained by killing stuff and is generally above 50$ per kill. The highest I have gotten so far is $1248 for killing a zombie with a melee headshot. Both currencies can be used to buy everything except skins, which require real money or to randomly find them in game to earn. Many people have downvoted this game for some of the things I listed, but I personally think this is one of the better pvp experiences I've had in a good while. My opinion may change in the future, but these are my thoughts so far. I hope that this review was helpful to you."},

You have the option to buy into the game or grind. A few pros are being different, small friendly community, large maps, customiation, gun options, grouping.

{"recommended": true, "review": "Okay. So I've got 10 hours into the game. At first, it was a rough start. At this stage, I think I could claim Infestation as a simplified, cheaper version of the Arma II Dayz mod. Dayz lite. And, for a *FREE* game, it's damn good, imo. Damn good. It was completely what I was looking for. However. Food is especially scarce in this game. Especially scarce. I might want to support the development, as well, because of how well I think they did with the game. However, I did have a couple issues lagging up and the game freezing. 2 times out of 10 hours. There is also a real sense of anxiety when you see other players. \"Are they a good guy? Are they a bad guy? Will they shoot me or give me medical supplies?\" I love that aspect. It's not all player killers, not in PvE, anyway. A player gave me, like, 15 medical supplies and food when I was injured. Though, you definitely still want to be careful if you hear gunfire.l It's fun to run around meeting people, and the in-game voice chat is cool. Though, it kind of sucks that when you're in a group, you can't really voice chat to them privately. When you talk, everyone in proximity will hear you, which makes operations a bit problematic. Another issue is that groups are limited to 3, so I was told by a player. I'm not sure what reasoning they had for this, since cars can fit 6-9 people in them. I googled the game and saw there used to be a bunch of spawn killers who would camp on spawnpoints and kill new players. Thankfully, temporary invincibility (I think), solves that issue. I haven't been spawn killed, at all. You'll spend most of your time running around trying to find food and liquid. [And of course, killing zombies and either avoiding or teaming up with players--or killing them on sight, if you're a jerk] It's a bit ironic to me that guns and military grade vests are much, much, much easier to find than food. It was very frustrating to me, starting out. And I get it. Zombie Apocolypse. Most of the food has been eaten. But, have most of the animals been eaten, too? All of the plant life? Adding in some alternate sources of food wouldn't hurt, imo. In addition, your character will starve to death in, like, an hour gametime. Maybe sooner, I haven't timed it. This equals like, maybe a day in-game. More like half a day, if you ask me. Now. Starving to death due to not eating for half a day--or even two days--doesn't really make sense to me. So it was quite irritating. As you gain experience points, you can invest in skills which allow you to last longer without food. My advice is kill as many zombies as you can, because, it seems that killing is the only way to gain experience. First skill you buy is in the survival tree, so you can last longer without food. My first few attempts were riddled with irritation at being unable to find food. Also. There are car spawn locations. There *are* vehicles. And if you know where to find them--like major cities--it makes travel around the map MUCH easier. However, most of the vehicles are just for looks. Which I found a bit unfortunate, but I get it, I guess. You'll notice the specific cars which don't work, and the specific ones that do. Googling would help, as well. One other issue I have with the game is how difficult zombies are to kill. It takes around 125 body shots, unarmed, to kill them. Okay, that makes some sense. I couldn't really tell you could aim for the head. It takes 4-10 knife stabs to the head to kill a typical zombie. I suppose this makes some sense for a game's purposes, and it definitely makes zombies a dangerous thing. It was still a bit irritating having to stab a zombie 10 times in the head for it to die. You'll want to be cautious. Some also run faster than you. Thankfully, all zombies except Super Zombies die with one headshot with a firearm. I think I might be playing this game a lot more. I don't really understand why it has mixed reviews. In my book, this is a gem for a free game. You don't have much to lose giving it a shot. I would just recommend playing for at least 5-10 hours, so you can get over the small learning curve."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "It is a fun game to play but you need to remember several things when playing or you will end up like the other angry reviews. 1. Its a free to play game. It is not a triple A game and has tons of issues and sometimes you will want to just turn everything off and watch Family Guy but if you give it a chance and get past the start, it is interesting 2. It's a hoarding game. You spawn into the forest and need to get as much supplies as possible, leave game to store, then join again and repeat until you feel like you have the supplies you need. I personally have tons of simple weapons for PVP purposes. Players dont realize that you WILL die and lose things you loved, so stash more so you can come back. 3. You just need to kill players. Sadly you never know whos a friend and who is not so, although douchey, its a part of the game. I personally just try to join servers with less players and scout areas out before i go in. 4. YOU need to make the game. The devs give you tools and game modes but you need to figure out what makes it fun for you. Dont join and only hoard stuff then say the game is boring because thats all it is. if you only do 1 thing, thats all it is for you. Join high pop. servers and player hunt or play the royal mode and try to survive to the end. 5. Take your time. This is not a run and gun zombie game like left for dead. Fire fights with players can take seconds or minutes and you may die without firing a shot. My cousin and i mainly play together and we often end up in a situation where one of us is killed in seconds from an ambush and the other is stuck behind a car trying to figure out whats going on. We have 5 second encounters where we run into a player or 2 and we have 15 minute pot shot fights with a single player. Dont try to make the game something its not and dont expect the game to do everything for you."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "I'm gonna post a honest review, as objectively as I can, because I, as well, have been with this title since the beginning and how it all went went south REALLY hard, which I will in no way defend. That being said, the reason I recommend is, is that while because the game is far from perfect, it has a special place for me, merely because of how much enjoyment I get out of it with friends. That being said, WARNING: DO NOT EXPECT A PROPER ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME WITH BASE BUILDING AND HUGE PVE AND LOOT ASPECTS. THIS GAME IS FAIRLY PVP FOCUSED AND YOU WILL SEE THIS IN THE LOOT SPAWNS FOR EXAMPLE. Do not go in expecting the ''next best thing'', because it's not and you'll be disappointed. The loot drops are abundant. You'll find guns very easily. You'll find bullets very easily. Looting is barely a chore, but to me, still very fun. You can decide to store it all in your global inventory or you can do it mostly like I do; loot a lot, but keep it all on you so when you die (and you will), you'll have to loot all over again instead of being decked out in elite gear right from minute 1. I only keep a few things in my global inventory, like ammo and snipers.  The loot is so abundant because it's primarely a PvP game. I thought I would've disliked it, but it's not all that bad. The beginner servers are ridiculous loot wise, it's a bit better on the normal servers, but you won't have a hard time finding them. The anticheat they have in place so far seems to work. Is it flawless? Probably not but barely any anticheat these days is. Even huge AAA titles get hacked, so the fact it stops 99% of the hacks is pretty damn good and I haven't encountered one yet so far. These are DIFFERENT developers that bought the license from the previous devs/publishers. This is why they are listed as the publishers, but they do not actually control any of it. They've had an agreement on the license, nothing more. They do not hold any strings, because if they did, trust me it wouldn't be as free2play as it is now. Pay2Win? No, this game is not. Everything you can buy in the shop, you can buy with either in game currency or just loot it. The ONLY things you can buy with real life money are skins and even those are found in game. You cannot buy guns in the shop. You can buy ammo, but only with in game currency and it's not even expensive. You get a huge amount of dollars per zombie kill, so farming is worth it for that alone. There's barely nothing I haven't been able to buy, but i've actually did not buy a single thing in the shop, not even premium. So far i'm 100% free2play and it's EXTREMELY easy to loot. So people calling this pay2win has lost all meaning to the word pay2win and will slap it on anything that has a cash shop. To them even World of Warcraft is pay2win because you can buy a level 100 character. Or battlefield. Or any other game with microtransactions. This game isn't for everyone, i'll admit that. It'll be left with a very experienced veteran community player base that will make your life hell in game. It's not beginner friendly if you're not going in with the idea that you want to learn the game. If you want a loot based survival game, this will probably not be for you. However, do you want a PvP game with actually solid mechanics (even this you can argue about, but it's all opinions) while you have to loot for food and guns/ammo on the side? This game could possibly be it for you. Graphical wise, this game isn't good. I mean I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the most ugliest game ever, but it certainly isn't th\u00e1t pretty. It has a lot of missing textures, the animations are clunky and overall leaves a lot to be desired to. Graphical wise this game hasn't improved much if any, but hey, let's face it, we all didn't buy minecraft for the graphics either, now did we? Or played runescape because it's ''so pretty''? While it's not the ugliest game out there, it's very noticeable that graphical wise, the game is unfinished and if you're a graphic \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, you'll be extremely annoyed at it. Hell, even I was a bit and usually graphics (considering the gameplay is nice, that is) don't bother me too much. But be warned, graphically you'll probably dislike it if you care about it a lot. Long story short; it's a game with a long, bloody history and while I totally understand people steering away from it, I encourage you to jump in with a friend and try it for a few hours. I am fairly confident you'll be put into an exciting situation that'll leave your heart racing, because despite all the hate, despite the fact the game is currently merely a fan made game, it brought me one of the best moments in gaming in general and not many games have been able to do that for me. If you want a PvP based game with looting on the side and farming zombies on the side, you might enjoy it. Just do not expect this perfect survival zombie shooter with PvP on the side, because that is NOT what it is. It's not for everyone."},

It was in an Internet-Caf\u00e9 during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up. I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called \"CS Promod\" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked. After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read). Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you. However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you. I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight"},

To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve: * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100 * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable Good luck!"},

So the latest update ( adding wingman and scoutgame) I think thats pretty good. Only thing is they should change the wingman stuff.

{"recommended": false, "review": "You think every single review here is fake and they're all salty cheaters?  I thought so too. Recently, Rockstar decided to remove cash from players' accounts because \"they have illegitimate money.\" The last two weeks were really good for GTA:O with profitable events and discounts, making money wasn't so bad. But the moment they released Smuggler's Run trailer, they started purging accounts. They literally \"stole\" 8.7 million from me. Some people lost 150k, some lost 20+ million. This is not PC exclusive, people lost money on PS and XBOX too. I'm not saying all these people are innocent but i know i've been playing my *ss off (activity;280 hours past 2 weeks) but apperantly they don't like it when you earn too much. I still have decent amount of money, but that doesn't change the fact that they stole cash from my account out of nowhere. Too much real life parody there. I lost millions because of the business bugs, glitches. (Supplies never arrive, 75k worth of supplies produce 63k worth of product, no production even though business is active etc...) I lost millions because Import/Export bugs. (Vehicle starts burning for no reason, sometimes 15 minute delivery timer reduces itself to 2-3 minutes. When you're about to sell, a long loading screen then cars are gone or invisible,etc... ) I lost hours, when you're done with a sale, sometimes you receive \"Transaction Error, price is invalid.\" or \"Transaction error, too much activity in your account.\" I'm sure that was suppose to be against modders. Guess what? I play legit, i get an error. In the next session a modder's dropping 50k cash every 30 seconds. What happened to my business? I lost some of my product, recieved no money. I can try selling it again and hope i won't get any errors this time. What about Rockstar Support?  They're worse than Nexon. Nexon doesn't give a sh*t. Rockstar doesn't give a sh*t plus they damage your in-game experience. I sent about six tickets, i got three different responses. No, it's not because they ignore your ticket. They have a support catalog or something where they copy&paste the best answer for your question. Please take a look at these responses. These are real. Response for the transaction errors. \"We're good, your connection is sh*t, go away\";  Response for the lost Import/Export vehicles. I don't know what to think about this; Reponse for the second lost Import/Export vehicles. Now, there're a lot of scumbag youtube \"content creators\" out there. They give people tips on \"How to get free cash from Rockstar Support\" you know, clickbait bullsh*t. Now, i get this treatment because of that. This is Rockstar Support for you. I've had similar issues last year, but they actually helped back then, sent me the money i lost and stuff. I don't know what changed this year. \"Oh, you've played 1800 hours, you got your money's worth.\" That's not how it works. That playtime includes loading screens, connection errors and my no-life grinding... They make truckloads of money from Shark Cards and they keep releasing new content. But with every new update, the game gets more outrageous and exploitative. Shark Card prices weren't enough. OpenIV scandal, ridiculous drip feeding content and now this. DLCs in this game are NOT free unless you play (grind) 5-6 hours a day. The fandoms on Rockstar forums are pathetic. This game is not worth it, even for single player. They still haven't released a single thing for the single player. Do not support this corporate nonsense. I'd say it's a shame because the game is really good but nope, i have nothing good to say. Stay away from this company. Update: Now they constantly change vehicle stats, can you guess why? They released a supercar that costs 2.4 million. It was faster than anything else in it's class, but for a week. It's third now. Again, more exploitative behaviour from Rockstar.. If you have any doubts, read the review comments. -Reuploaded the links. This travesty should not be forgotten. You are part of the problem if you purchase a single game from Take-Two."},

Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck.  Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC. This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned. **EDIT 03/29/18 -  A majority of the falsely banned players, myself included, have been unbanned with all of our accounts intact.. to promptly being banned once again with the same response Rockstar had in the beginning of this mess.

{"recommended": false, "review": "Take-Two just killed the modding scene for this game dead.   Open IV was the main mod that modders used to make their mods. Mods that allowed you to do fun things in the single player like spawning in jets or turning yourself into Homer Simpson and driving his car around or enabling moon gravity. I say WAS because Take-Two issued a cease and desist to the mod author. The mod author couldn't fight it, so they stopped distribution of Open IV.   The likely reason Take-Two killed this mod that only affects the single player is because there are vehicles in the (god-awful microtransaction hell) online mode that aren't available in the single player. This mod is used for mods that allow you to spawn those vehicles into the single player. Take-Two dislike this because they want to push people to play the inferior online mode because that's where all the microtransactions are. The online is missing a lot of features from the single player but it's the only place you can pilot the Hydra jet, for example. Oh, you actually want to pilot the Hydra jet? You'll have to grind for cash for days or buy it for real money.   It's worth noting the single player story for this game is actually great, but the sudden absence of mods is disappointing, the way Take-Two treat it's modding community is disgusting and they way they see their player base is just insulting. All because they weren't happy to have only the fourth best selling game of all time.   \"We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a per-user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers.\" -Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two CEO.   \"But we're not trying to optimize the monetization of everything we do to the nth degree. My concern is, if you do that, the consumer knows. They might not even know that they know, but they feel it.\" -Strauss Zelnick, a man who would love to take every penny you have if he wasn't afraid you'd realise, a man who thinks YOU are too stupid to know you're playing a game where everything is locked behind a paywall.  We know, Strauss. We know."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "The parent company of Rockstar, the developer of this game is pushing micro-transactions and sacrificing the singleplayer just to push people to the multiplayer, which has microtransactions.

{"recommended": false, "review": "TLDR; The game is fun but Rockstar and Take-Two provide no specific information regarding suspension or bans. Even if bans are final, this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue. To make it clear, my current temporary suspension is a false-positive to my knowledge. I requested further information regarding the EULA violation from their support team. They chose not to provide infomration on the EULA violation, nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the EULA. I can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible. ----------------------------------------------- Until this week I would have recommended GTA V as a great game. It has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least, Rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities / missions / events with more than four players, which is a common pitfall of most co-operative games. This has given the game replay value, which led to the large number of hours I have played it. Whenever my friends and I needed a game we all were happy to play, GTA V was commonly the choice. I will acknowledge that GTA V itself is a great game to play with friends, and alone. However, on Monday - whilst mid-mission, GTA V's anti-cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension. Like a broken record, I will say that I do not cheat, exploit, or mod the game, nor do I have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory.  At the time, I summised that GTA V's cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background. Most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code, control window handles, or view memory. I am relatively sure that it was my AS Rock tuning utility - which was monitoring sensory data, that is the culprit. I deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that I had not run while running GTA V over a long period of time. However, I can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the GTA V executable, nor its online service. I do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension (which I am quite happy to do - understand that an anti-cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally) and then find that I am permanently banned. The problem with this game isn't the anti-cheat engine itself. In software engineering of this nature, there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats. So many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti-cheat engine more aggressive - result: more false positives.  The problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff. I sent a message to support - not asking to appeal the ban (explicitly telling them that I did not wish to appeal), but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that I could determine what caused the issue. The support message was viewed three times according to their \"latest activity\" timer over two days, and then \"Charles\" provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue. This is the problem. Rockstar and Take-Two's line is that \"everyone is banned\" for a reason - and therefore bans are final. If they enforce this, then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred. Providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn't tell me what set it off your anti-cheat engine. More so, it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information. Furthermore, there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense. In particular, in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor (i.e. they stop online support for the game). By permanently banning someone (i.e. terminating online services to that registered account), this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct. If they don't provide proof of the infraction, then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services. The burden of proof is on Take-Two or Rockstar to prove that you violated the EULA. If they can't provide the evidence, then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own EULA. Since the EULA is essentially a contract, they are legally liable in this scenario. If the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the EULA, then I would recommend this game - because then the game/service/or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false. As it is, Rockstar, Take-Two, nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information. Furthermore, the support channels they provide for EULA violations (i.e. bans) provides no further assistance in the issue - why have it at all? Just tell us that you don't answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time. So as it stands, I will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information. Hence, I do not recommend this game because at this time, I can not fully utilise the product without risk of the Licensor (Take-Two) violating the conditions of their EULA in the termination section (i.e. permanently banning me) and with no possiblity of the Licensee (Me) seeking appeal or remedy."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick: 1. Loading screens take forever. 2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking. 3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done. 4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck. 5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying. 6. The f*cking loading screens X___X 7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up. 8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace. 9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest. 10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.  11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever. 12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol. 13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life. 14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be). 15. And shark cards can gobble my balls. _________________________________________________________________ Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"},

The only thing you get is their typical copy/paste answer how their anticheat is flawless, and you are the one who broke EULA rules, but which one? Who knows...

But, before I begin, there's something you must know - The first two FlatOut games were made by Bugbear Entertainment, and they were phenominal racing games, especially FlatOut 2. This game? Totally different company that completely misunderstood everything Bugbear had done right.  First things first, the AI is pitiful. I know the name of the game is destruction, literally, but it's a RACING game, and I'd rather have people using force to win the race than veering off the track in the first lap to wrestle in the grass like kittens. On this note, *everyone* targets you. I went into one demolition derby round, and it was hilariously stupid the way it worked. As soon as the countdown hit zero, the twenty-or-so other non-player racers veered to the opposite side like the Persian army and all ganged up on me at once, with the exception of, what, like, two motorists smashing each other's bumpers in. I mean, I played FlatOut 2's derby mode religiously, and it sometimes feels like the AI prioritizes you over their brethren, but even in it worst state it was nothing compared to this insanity. Now, it's time to compare it to its predecessors - Yes, Flatout 3 was made by a different company than the first two, but being a sequel by its title, I have to rate it in comparison to its past successes in the franchise. The other NPC's -- The way this development team tried to recreate Bugbear's non-player character gimmick is awful. If you haven't played FlatOut 2, lemme give you the jist of things - There were seven NPC's that were the only opponents in the game. They all had distinct driving styles, color schemes, and skills in different racing areas. They were so memorable thanks to this that you had those names ingrained into your brain after your first couple of races and figured out very quickly whose names to curse every time you launched out of your windshield. Well, 3 messes this all up. There are something near 15 characters, and some of them are so similar that you have no hope of remembering them. The character models are all very idealized, if you catch my drift, and there's one fully anonymous man wearing a motorcross helmet with practically full-balanced stats that you'll choose every time if you're sane. That's another thing, too - Unlike the original, where you were your own identity, you have to choose one of these punks. Anyway, 2.5/10, because it technically functions, I guess. Go buy Next Car Game instead, it's made by the same company that made the other FlatOut games. Speaking of which, go buy the other FlatOut games, too, they're super cheap and also on Steam.

{"recommended": false, "review": "I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth.  Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of \"fundamentals of gameplay\" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay.  -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server.  -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.  Final Rating:  -Game 9/10 -Game community 3/10"},

Instead, there now lies weekly hat updates, and a game update every couple of months of so If the developers are feeling it.  Not only is the development side of valve lackluster, but, with the recent community aspirations for the annual 'diretide' event, Valve has now not only ignored the celebratory season, but what is really saddening is their community management/responsiveness when it comes to such events in general.

{"recommended": true, "review": "I must say that there are many ups and downs in this game. The story is very interesting and mysterious since there are things you will only know or figure out at the end. This is a nice touch I really liked. I also like how the characters interact with each others. And not just between main characters but also with random people in the streets. The news at the radio stations are also very well done, including the conversations with the HQ from a radio in a police car or other emergency vehicles. All this is quite well scripted.  The other types of details are things such has trespassing inside someone's garden where they own a dog, the dog might go after you just because you are a stranger. Driving over a weapon on the ground can cause it to fire. An heavy car accident can cause a leak in the fuel tank. Or even forcing the engine of a damaged vehicle can overheat it and stall it or could even catch on fire. A vehicle on fire does not necessarily mean it can explode in 10 seconds anymore, that can take 2 minutes, which is very well done! An exploded vehicles can still have flashing lights, alarms and tires still inflated. Those are some very nice details which someone perfectionist like me is looking for. But there is more, like shooting an electric box can turn some lights off or cause sparkles. All lights in the game can be shot or can be broken, from buildings, lamp posts, pools, etc.. You can cut vegetations with various weaponry, knives, helicopter's rotor blades, vehicle crash, etc... Every vehicle's dashboard has its own meters for various things such has the speed, temperature, fuel, handbrake, engine condition, headlights, stronger headlights and flashing lights. Altitude, horizon and compass for planes and such. The AIs seems to have been improved from its predecessor \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" for the survival and tactical point of view. They will do everything they can to take you on or run away from you. They drive quite differently every time, but still as ruthless and impatient as ever. They either drive faster, be scared, give you the middle finger or want to kick your butt if you honk at them. Wild animals behave realistically from afar but seems to be slow for their reaction times at close range. Each weaponry has their own statistics and they feels pretty accurate. Like the Micro-SMG will shoot all over the place like a powerful Micro-SMG should be doing. The SMG (MP5 look) is accurate, quick and feels like the one from your named-favorite FPS game. Entering a convenience store and hearing the cashier saying \"I just opened\" or \"I am about to finish my shift\" is actually pretty well done. By the look at the time in-game, you can see that the guy will say that during a specific time of the day, either 6 PM, 6 AM, 12 PM. For the bad details; Modified weaponry will have all their attachments removed once you are using them inside a vehicle excepts for sight/scope. Suppressor, grip and probably the extended magazine will be gone from your weapons temporarily. Vehicle's distortion is actually awful and unrealistic. Unlike Grand Theft Auto IV, vehicles can not bend like you want them to bend. Landing violently a vehicle on the roof can not flat it, it will remain solid like if the vehicle had a roll-cage in it. If a roll-cage was actually installed, that would make sense. I believe they did that so the head of your character or AI does not pop-out of the roof for more realism. Indestructible side mirrors too. You can scratch your vehicle somewhere, the scratch will not be on the right spot. Some AI will die in car crashes if you go at 10 MPH. Customizing a vehicle is pretty odd, nothing in the options will actually bring the top speed higher, only the acceleration and braking ability. The traction will stay the same. Some customization are pretty useless. I do not know much about mechanics, but if I am correct, bringing the suspension down should improve handling and aerodynamic for better top speed? In this game, nothing happen but does improve traction. Having no music will bring-up various default themed soundtracks, it is all good and all, but this soundtrack can not be brought down during voice chat if you set it to 0 to clearly hear people talking. You have to go to Audio instead of Voice Chat and bring the music way down. It could be a bug. I must be unlucky, or Rockstar Games lied to us when they said that we could hunt in Online session, I did not see a single wild animal yet during my play-time. No cats, no dogs, no deer, no rabbits, no boars, no cows, nothing. Normally, an \"armored vehicle\" should also have bulletproof windows, right? Or is it just me thinking that? The only vehicle with bulletproof windows are police vans, and N.O.O.S.E trucks. Nothing else... You can also get shot inside a tank which does not make any sense, and of course, it is only 1 player inside a tank despite the fact that there is a mounted machinegun on top of it. Some planes have backseats, but only 2 players can get in. There is no pretty houses online, the only thing pretty are modern apartments. I bought a house near of Martin Madrazo's location, it is not that bad but could be better for a house. And from the inside, I got windows which are actual walls from the outside.. Does not make any sense. Same thing actually with Macheal's house, if you look carefully, there was windows shown outside which is actually a wall and a library inside. The shower in online mode is pointless, all it does is cleaning your clothes from bullet holes and blood, but your face will still have bruises, they can not be removed unless you go back to story mode and then online again. Despite the fact that the AI has been somehow improved, Rockstar Game did a better job in GTA IV with the police. In V, they will try to kill you every time. There is not a single time in this game where I actually got busted and I tried to be arrested. In IV, with one star the cops will run after you unless you show a firearm in your hand, they will try to shoot you. But in V, weapons or not, you are dead for them. Another thing, which is rather funny but not really realistic, you are caught in a chase, but you are in a jet. Fly close to the street and you might hear them saying; \"Get out of the car!\"... what? \u0c20_\u0c20  This game does not have a filter, you can not really search for a full session like in IV, you have to spam the New Session if you wish to find a session with more people. The server seems to have a terrible connection, I have a very good Internet connection, 4 ping, 60 MBps .D /30 MBps .U and I keep losing connection, actually I am still in-game but everyone in the session leave at the same time. For online, in IV being in a stealth stance could actually hide your display name, but in V, there is no point in being stealthly.. And speaking of stealth, this new stance is awful.. in IV you could crouch, but in this one, it is no longer possible. It could also save your life avoid to have your head shot. The cover feature in V does not always work like you want it to work. In IV, I could tip someone who was singing in the street or playing saxophone, guitar, etc.. but in this game, it seems like we are some cheap prick. And the last one are hackers/cheaters. Online is filled with griefers spawning clones on you, attaching characters on you, forcing someone to molest you, spawn static objects, antennas, UFO, etc shoot fire spray, air spray, water spray, money, removing all your weapons, money, killing everyone instantly, downgrade levels, etc."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath. PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold. My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion: 1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite. 2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends. 3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons. 4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean.  5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated. 6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation. 7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS. 8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future. 1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke. As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency. 2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point 3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game. 4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag. 5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly. As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game. 6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive 7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly. Don't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale. Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers! UPDATE: Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to   take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes. UPDATE 2: This review was made before the era of the 'stream sniping' and the microtransaction drama. I haven't played the game for a while so I lack proper first-hand experience to update my review. With that said, keep in mind that this review is outdated."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds In my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released. +Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre +Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs) +Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them +The game in most aspects visually looks great +Plenty of weaponry (For release) +Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\"  +Nice animations for all weapons currently in game +The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere  ++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" )  -Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon)  -Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone)  Aside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning.

{"recommended": true, "review": "600 hours of experience and very well known on the workshop, so I pretty much have seen it all. Unturned is rather mixed. Most servers follow a pay to win format and are focused on PvP (get lucky to find a gun and kill everyone you meet) or die trying. These servers are trash. However if you join a server without plugins such as TPA and kits, it is completely different. It feels like a survival game more than a FPS. You get to build a base... only to get offline raided, fight off zombies while exploring towns, military bases, and other places. You get a chance to be the best rather than paying for a free gun kit and plane. But why do I recommend this game? Simple. Besides the current state, it has been improving greatly since what it used to be a long time ago. The community has improved to an extent, the recent addition of bullet drop and scope sway makes sniping require more skill rather than a simple point, click the head and get an instant kill, and the workshops includes mods to suit almost anyone. The workshop- it's brilliant. Nelson has done a good job with the additions he has made to Unturned, but the workshop has a lot of good content, including a lot of gun and hat skins (which has caused the economy to be similar to CS:GO or TF2) there are maps that can go up to 64 square kms and dwesigned for a lot of gamemodes. There's maps designed for survival similar to Washington/PEI and works well due to it's design, Maps that allow you to race, Maps such as mine (Isle of Wolves) which is based on progression, and of course arenas and maps to try and replicate famous maps such as Chernarus and Dust II. And some modders have added many workshop guns and vehicles too. Want to fire away at a horde of zombies with a minigun while your friend is flying you around on a Hummingbird? Now you can. The graphics is rather a blocky and simple design. I don't dislike the design, but some people would be put off by it. Nelson has said he will improve it to have graphics that are similar to Firewatch. which I suppose is better, we'll have to find out ourselves. However this simple design makes it seem more like a cartoon than realism, which people could see it relate to games like Minecraft, just with guns. If you are one who doesn't want to play the game due to factors such as the community, go ahead. But you're missing out."},

I remember when i could join a server and not be shot as a naked and actually have fun whilst messing around. The game has a really good foundation but the community has gone.... eh over the years. I'm really hoping that Unturned 4.0 will make this fun again. I know it isn't entirely the developers fault the game has become like this but in it's current state, it is hard to recommend. I really hope that somehow this is turned around. Unturned 2.0 and 3.0 was my childhood and is where 99% of my friends come from (I'm lonely)."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So, Lets begin, I have 2200 hours on this game, so yes I know what the heck I am talking about. I ran/owned a server for 3 years as well.   The Good #1 - This is a fun game, graphics are basic but gameplay is excellent IMO. #2 - The players are typical young so the comuntiy is decent, you do have older peeps as well who play (like me) #3 - Modding,  this is an easy game to have modded servers with, you can do almost anyting in a server to mod this game. #4 - Tons of items in the Steamworkshop #5 - Tons of servers #6 - Game is updated constantly, this game is updated once a week if not more. The Bad #1 -  This is the worst thing about the game for me... the weekly Updates!! These tend to break every mod you have on the server, so every Saturday morning I was on fixing the servers and removing modded items that errored with the new updates. Every week I had issuses!!!  #2 - The Updates, So when the game updates you  get a ton of backlash from your players as why this gun is not working, or this vehicle won't work, etc, etc, So the updates would make us lose players to vanilia servers. (Vannila yuck!) So each update would see a loss of regular players as after a few updates they would get fed up with the problems. #3 - This game has a tiny team of developers working on it, so it tends to take awhile to get bugs fixed. #4 - Tons of servers, this makes finding a game with others a chore. the player count is going down as well and this make this even worse. So after 3 years of fixing the server almost weekly I have given up on Unturned, also the comunity is diying as well, and I think it is due to all the updates reeking havok on dedicated players. If you just want to play single player once in awhile then this game is fine, Just.....Do Not Run A SERVER it will make you hate the game. Finish the game Nelson, then maybe I will return to a game I loved to play, 2200 hours of love!!"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So let me preface this review by stating that I have followed the development of this game from its VERY EARLY ALPHA STAGES. I played this game when it was a mere shadow of its former state, and while many changes have been made to the game, the overall game itself at its core is the same. However, this is a review of it's current state as of 8/19/2016 (The Release of the Russia Map) And here are my thoughts So for anyone that didn't know this is a game being developed by one guy and I must say, what he's done with it is really damn impressive and he deserves praise! Unturned has achieved things as a free to play game that games like H1Z1, DayZ Standalone, Rust, and others like it have yet to achieve and all of those games require a purchase. One thing I must praise this game for is its FTP model. It is 100% Free to Play. There are no paywalls, timers, buffs for buying into the game, or anything of the like. It's reasons like this that I actually bought into this game years ago to support its development. It was and still is only 5 bucks and while it doesn't necessarily grant you a whole ton of stuff (Extra Hud Customization, Access to Gold Tier servers, and some cosmetic items) I still don't regret my purchase in the slightest. This is a damn good game that has evolved into something that resembles Arma or the DayZ mod rather than something like H1Z1.  So why am I downvoting this game? After all I certainly have enough hours in it and I have nothing but praise to give to the game. Well....this game as of late has had some....problems. Specifically with the way that servers are being handled and also with some gameplay elements that have been added that really make no sense.  My biggest problem with this game is the way it handles servers....or rather the community that runs the servers. This game is meant to be played in a server with a medium to high tier population if you ask me. It adds tension knowing that other players could be around and you're all struggling for survival in a large landspace. The problem however deals with the servers themselves. The community has effectively turned Unturned into an FPS rather than the survival game it used to be. You will be hard pressed to find a server these days that doesn't feature map teleportation, kits that you spawn in with that kill the purpose of ya know....surviving, and other features like this that really just make the game an FPS played on a big map. If you do manage to find a reasonable server with a Vanilla ruleset 9/10 times it will be run by abusive admins who have sealed off spots with high tier loot and abuse their powers to the extreme.  It's a damn shame this game doesn't have some form of official servers at this point because the community is becoming cancerous to players that want to play the game as it was intended. I got on today to play the newly released Russia Map (Which is spectacular btw) and once again the server issue persisits and it has been here for the last 3 months now and it's just getting worse. It really sucks all the fun and playability out of the game. I honestly love this game, it's the one Early Access game I will support hands down, but at this point I will leave the review negative until they fix the glaring issue with its servers. I would love nothing more than to change this to a positive when the issue is resolved! If the server issues are resolved I highly encourage you to hop in the game and give it a try for yourself. It's got a great crafting system, some rather advanced gun physics compared to other games in it's genre, and while its building system could use some work it is still pretty fun. I will continue to check in on Unturned periodically in the hopes that the server issue is resolved.  Thanks for reading and if you've played, what are your thoughts? Do you agree, disagree, think I'm a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing pleb that needs to git good? I'm curious. Leave a comment and I'll definitely get back to you on it if you're interested."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Rust isn't about building a pretty fort with your friends, logging out and then coming back tomorrow to pick up where you left off. No, Rust is about psychology. I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the \"clothed\" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won't enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "_______________________________ This game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it. Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place. _______________________________ At the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it. After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't. For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them. This resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart. _______________________________ When you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree. The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game. These are named:  . Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love. A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.  - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped. _______________________________ _______________________________ Well, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones. _______________________________ If you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game. _______________________________ I'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I'm just giving you my two cents about the game."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday. Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked,\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665(penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring. Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness. I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse. Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death. Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me. In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources\u2014the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign. But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust.  I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults. It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn't laugh my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, \"Hey man, wait a second!\" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "Alright, so here\u2019s my 2 cents after almost 500 hours in the last few months THE EXPERIENCE -solo is essentially impossible if you\u2019re playing near any populated rad towns.  -don\u2019t even bother playing on solo/duo/trio servers, they die after the first few days of wipe -do not even consider playing on face punch servers, play on rustafied -good luck getting on rustafied with their 200+ people waiting queue on wipe day  -modded servers are pretty fun, 1.5x-2x is the way to go, anything above that and you\u2019re not really having fun. (Essentially cheating in everything in the very beginning of a campaign. It just ruins the experience) THE SCRAP GRIND  -scrap grind isn\u2019t necessarily that bad, but expiramenting on workbenches is awful - there are 3 tiers of workbenches: Level 1 has simple blueprints (cheap revolvers, ghetto shotguns, regular pistol bullets, simple stuff, unreliable explosives)  Level 2 has higher tier blueprints (smgs, better pistols, semi auto rifles, better armor) Level 3 is the endgame workbench with the best loot. (AK, explosive ammo, c4, rockets, rocket launchers, metal armor, sniper rifle)  In the game there is expiramenting on the workbench, where you can get a blueprint that you don\u2019t already have. This system for as it is is a gamble, and it\u2019s pretty good for the lower level benches. Only 75 scrap for the level 1, and it\u2019s actually pretty good for its price. If you don\u2019t have the revolver (probably one of the most important guns in the beginning of the wipe) you can get the revolver, and then research the bullets that come with it. With the level 2 it is still pretty much worth it to expirament. Getting a semi rifle can really bridge the gap for you from being primal to getting good loot. The level 3 expiramenting is very iffy however. You can get really good items like the AK, bolt action sniper, metal chest plate and mask, etc. Researching on the level 3 is super high risk high reward. You on one hand have the possibility of getting an AK, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, or you can get incendiary 5.56 (rifle ammo that is stupid expensive, and nobody uses it) and you need to nearly get another level 3 workbenches worth of scrap to do it.  THE PVP  -Where do I start. PvP is awful on this game.  -god awful stuttering, even with very good PCs -pvp favors the client side, instead of serverside  Let\u2019s say you are watching someone go across an open field and suddenly they stop, great time to tap them right? Wrong. They for 1: Aren\u2019t frozen Are yards ahead of what you see Most likely already killing you. PROJECTILE_INVALID Is your number one enemy while pvping BASES  - Nothing bad I can really bash this game about on their building side. The roof is just one big problem they need to get rid of completely  -decay isn\u2019t a problem unless you\u2019re a 1 man inside a 10 man sized base  -high external walls are a good way to scare people off; show that you mean business. RAIDING -three different kinds of raiding  -onlining is pretty much only to prove a point. It is inferior to offlining, but it\u2019s the gentleman\u2019s way of doing it. It\u2019s essentially impossible to succeed in, unless only a few are online and you are chocked full of explosives. The defenders can just build a wall and metal all your hard work in less than a second (seriously) -offlining is the safer way to do it, but less noble way. You do this if you want loot. Nobody to defend the base, should be smooth sailing. The only problem are the counter raiders. -raiding for the sake of being an \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. These raiders grief bases. The place metal walls in inconvenient places, they wall off doorways, destroy workbenches. Please don\u2019t do this. DEFENDING YOUR BASE -Rust is actually stressful, like seriously. -you spend hours defending your base to make sure it doesn\u2019t get offlined - you wake up thinking \u201cI really hope I haven\u2019t gotten offlined\u201d -you stay up late to make sure nobodies schemin\u2019 -it overall takes a toll on your sleep schedule, and it\u2019s more of a chore to play rust than it is a treat. HOW THE GAME WORKS  The game is essentially like life. The harder you work in the begging, the better your life is in the end.  If you grind all day every day in the beginning of wipe, you can spend your final days in rust not worrying about scrap, upkeep, etc. You can just raid and pvp.  I\u2019m too lazy to finish this review, I\u2019ll do it later. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty good game."},

I got frustrated or raged in games before but I have never had a big adrenalin rush before or had a cocktail of many different feelings in a game before. The first week of Rust burned into my memory, remembering running scared and losing myself in the game, it was too much. It was a Love & Hate, for which I kept coming back. You can become a hero or rich in a second and lose it all in another second and you can become the villain you despised so much. You will meet horrible people and great ones. With Rust, my game expectations changed so much that I can't play single-player games for very long now. I used to be lone gamer, but this game made me buy headphones with a microphone, my friend list went from 0 to 30. I started following YouTubers. I learned new words. I am not that salty anymore against toxic players, PvP became a norm, PvE became fun, going deep became a goal\u2026 It even had effect on my life that possession became more irrelevant - that this game showed me everything is fleeting over and over again.

It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library.

Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent. It is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much. You will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome. To me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better. I have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously. Get killed, laugh, try to get better, die more, laugh even more. XD Left 4 Dead forever haha."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "After many have tried, Studio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly that, with an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster? ARK puts you in the shoes of a half-naked guy (or gal), stranded on the eponymous ARK, the island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your character, although like in many other games, anything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscled, giraffe-necked dwarf or super tall, onyx-skinned valkyrie?), but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specific, meaning you can have one on every server.  Your character will start the game with nothing to his or her name, true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gatherer, as your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get wood, but doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.).  Even at this early point, the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Huge, prehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill you, however, some just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each other, as the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself.  Players should quickly realise that most of the island's monsters are beyond their combat-capabilities and that they should steer clear of the particularly agressive ones dwelling on land, in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same time, ARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over time, with a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributes, as well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventure, later down the line you may pick up the recipes for weapons, buildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high level, so specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit.  The unwritten goal in ARK, for most players, is to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeed, whoever has played Rust will immediately feel at home, as the whole game plays very much like it. This includes player's characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnects, adding additional treat to potential raiders, who will be able to take all of your character's belongings even when you are not on the server. Of course, building a secure base will help combat this threat.  What sets ARK apart from Rust is its setting (frigging dinosaurs), its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen), its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players), you can choose to knock them unconscious instead, beginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventually, it will become your (and your tribe's) companion, able to aid you in combat, bear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinos, too!). What more needs to be said, really. Yes of course, the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devs, they did not expect such a large resonance initially, which caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Also, the stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in time, you need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag.  All of this was to be expected, really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In fact, the devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on content, wanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Access, which I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project.  Indeed, even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanics, with so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled out, resulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "tl;dr \u2014 worth it, loved it, but I'm not very hardcore. 300 hours on record, 100+ of those with my kids.  And now, STORYTIME:  I love playing co-op games with my kids. When I looked at   (currently in Early Access on Steam) it looked like just such a thing. When I dug into it and learned that I could host a LAN server in my house, and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generous, went all in with my sons.   Before long I had all four of my kids playing with me, and each other.   Currently my girls are the heavy hitters, training mobs of small dinosaurs, and then marching them into harm's way. The game's A.I. spawns some tough beasts, but short of the epic boss battles (which we have not bothered with), and the Alpha T-Rex (which we haven't run into), nothing stands for long against Keliana's swarm of dilophosaurs and dimorphodons, or Gleek's hopping mob of giant frogs.   Keliana and I did run into a bit of trouble with our expedition from the north-east river mouth, but that wasn't her fault. I shall now tell you about it.   We  attempted to bring 24 tamed dinos and one tricked-out crafting raft southwest through narrows and swamps. We discovered, after it was too late to turn around, that the size of our mob and the size of our raft made the trip extremely tedious. It didn't get dangerous until I got fed up and decided on a side trip.   My plan was simple. Ride Terry, my pteranodon who kept fouling the raft's travel, from our mob's location at the western edge of the Eastern Plains, east and south to a platform we'd been building in the middle of the Eastern Forest. There he'd be high, dry, and safe. I would then parachute back, timing my glide to get me most of the way to safety. It's a high platform, and I'd seen my son make that kind of glide before.   (Note: The logic that goes \"I saw my son do a thing in a game so it is a thing I can now do\" has never gotten me into trouble before, I swear.)   A dimorphodon named Zed was following me and Terry. Unfortunately, Zed fell behind, and I forgot he was there. I landed Terry safely, lined up my jump, and leapt back the way we'd come. My chute popped perfectly, and my glide was going to be LONG. Then Zed caught up, flew straight at me, and fouled the lines of my chute.   I dropped fast. Not killed-by-the-fall fast, but definitely short-of-my-goal-by-80% fast. I landed in a boulder-filled vale just to the west of the platform. The vale's only other major feature besides boulders was hungry carnivores. I emptied my shotgun into a 'raptor, then finished it off with a pike only to discover that a carnotaur had stopped quarreling with a pair of sabertooths, and was charging me.   Carnos charge in straight lines, and turn poorly. I used the terrain to my advantage, and attempted to lead him back into his sabertoothed foes. It worked perfectly, except for the part where they decided to share a meal. I now had three carnivores chasing me.  I almost ran headlong into another sabertooth, but it leaped and I ducked, and then I kept running.   \"Keliana, where are you?\"   \"North of that purple light. There's a cliff between me and you. You'll need to go around it.\"   I turned and checked to see how close pursuit was.   I screamed.   The game does a really good job of getting predators right. They don't roar or screech unless they're fighting. They come at you teeth-first, and quietly.   I had a perfect view of three sabertooths, one carnotaur, and behind them, just starting to take interest, a pair of tyrannosaurs who I may have run a bit too close to without noticing them.   \"THERE IS NO AROUND!\"   The nice thing about video-game cliffs is that if they're not sheer, sometimes you can cheat them, running sideways and down, and landing without having broken your bones. I did this, knowing that my pursuit could do the same thing.   I splashed through shallows at the base of the cliffs, and then saw that I was being charged from the front by a velociraptor. It was over.   Then I saw that the velociraptor had a saddle on it, and there was a woman in the saddle.   \"I've got you, Dad!\"   She and the mob swept past me. I missed what happened next, because it happened behind me. I did get game alerts telling me that my tribe's pets were killing things, but they went by too fast for me to count. I saw exactly zero flashing red alerts, which meant that Keliana had killed everything chasing me without taking any casualties.   That's my girl.   Are we playing this game the way it was meant to be played? If the online PVP tournaments are any indication, we're doing it all wrong.     Wrong is fine."},

(Not saying you need hours to judge, but that there is a reason many people have well over 1-2k hours in this game.) Ark is a childhood fantasy come true. It's like a mix of Jurassic Park and Minecraft with a touch of DayZ. Ark is the kind of game where if you ask for help or report a glitch on the forums you will be answered by an actual dev and the glitch will be addressed within hours to days. Wildcard Studios *from day one to the present* have been very responsive and are an excellent team. I can't give a rating out of 10 compared to a complete game because Ark is an alpha, but as alphas go; 100/10 Update: Over two years ago I heard about a survival game where you could hunt and tame dinosaurs. I checked out their website, watched their announcement trailer- and got goosebumps.      To this day Ark is the best EA game I've ever played. There have been a lot of changes and for a while I didn't like where the PVP was going, (booku saddles, forcefeeding bullet sponges, jet-powered Pteras, etc.), but there are always tweakable options so you can find or operate a server that's just right for you. People are currently pumping out bad reviews for Ark based on its release price, (like 7k recent salty reviews because of money politics,) and things like the *completely realistic and justified* flyer nerf- Don't let their hate make you miss out on this game. Compared to the average AAA game Ark was a steal at 30$. So wait for a sale, you won't be disappointed."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "After 6,000 Hours, I think I can finally write a review.  First off, this game is constantly being worked on. There is ALWAYS something new. I have played since day 1 (sometimes not very well ;) ) and I can say that this game has changed tremendously, overall for the good. Everything that is an issue is handled either by the Devs, Mod Creators or by Server Owners. Pros: *Being a server owner I look into all of the complaints and tweak the game to my player base liking.  *This game has everything you could want out of an MMO.  *Explorer notes to delve into the story-line *You can Roleplay *Grind out materials  *Build to your hearts content  *Tame hundreds of beautiful DINOSAURS <3 *Play solo  *Play with large groups *Constant updates and events *Private servers have actual communities, player bases and privately hosted events *Endless game-play on hundreds of different servers with different play styles. -- Re-playability, 100% --  *Any negative review you see can be handled by a personal server owner and should not be held negatively against the game. (Yeah i'm pretty sure i've read 90% of them over the years) *People of ALL AGES play. This is not just a \"child\" or \"old person\"'s game. I literally have players on my server from age 9 to 70. *Graphics quality - You might need a great computer to get full potential, but still gorgeous with lesser computers *Price/quality - Worth the Price if you can find a COMMUNITY. Solo playing is just as fun, but being in a tribe can really immerse you more and give you a sense of purpose in the game. *Difficulty - Depends on the SERVER. There are very many insanely easy and insanely difficult servers, you CAN find what suits you <3 *Game Length - Endless <3 *Story Line - Maybe difficult to follow unless you're the \"questing\" type, there are websites for this though. *Weather System *Crafting System - Engrams *People from ALL COUNTRIES can play this game with stability (Server Dependent)  *Can play PVE or PVP or BOTH! - at the same time! -See Community Servers <3 Middle Ground: I have seen Ark literally become people's escape / 2nd life. This game is very immersive!! Cons: *Sometimes it becomes people's second life *OFFICIAL SERVERS - These communities are not welcoming, and are normally dominated by one group over several hundred servers, normally you can not even play due to Omega tribes, and if you are GRANTED the right to play, you will be a \"farm \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\" for several hundred hours to prove yourself before you can do ANYTHING else. Official Servers are Toxic and make several thousand people quit monthly. *Random glitches depending on the maps (Bugs occasionally) *Graphics quality - You might need a great computer to get full potential, but still gorgeous with lesser computers *Story Line - Maybe difficult to follow unless you're the \"questing\" type, there are websites for this though. I would HIGHLY recommend this game, over and over. I even have customers (in my salon) I tell on a daily basis and give them the info for my servers and they become addicted quickly! This game is near perfection. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults, but the Pros far out-weigh the Cons!!!!

{"recommended": true, "review": "It all began with a noob trying to figure out the game alone on a pvp server. I didn't know it was pvp until i was raided, but i realized my thatch wasnt't going to stop anybody, so i rebuilt a wooden fortress, tamed a few dilos and raptors. Find a few other noobs and make a family together. Working hard and proud on our home, we ventured through our island chopping down trees, and killing what we could. Then the server wiped. We understood it was a great time to move to a better location, block off a cave and pray no one f****s with us. By the end of the day we're so much more advanced than others that we have no fear. Fast foward weeks, the chinese attack, killing all our dinos. Poor Rexes...i will miss you colossus. We liberate chinese held caves, and open them to the public. The whole server rallies to demolish the chinese griefer cells, and send them back to the stone ages. Fast forward a few more weeks, and things are peaceful. Expanded locations allowed us more resources and dinos, while also allowing fast travel locations. Then you get big tribes trying to police the world.  My final straw was realizing a group of four, could never take on a group of 15. I tried diplomacy, but realized, why the f*** am i going to these lengths for some Dbag i don't even know? I burned out on the diplomatic, and relations part of the game in pvp. Its too much of a pain to maintain those relationships constantly. If you're new, go pve to learn the basics.

Unfortunate since this game has the best construction mechanics in the Survival genre by far, but is ruined because you need to make a base layered and ugly in order to actually protect it. Its daily routine to logout from a 3 hour play session to go back the next day respawning on the beach again and again. The grind is pretty ridiculous and its virtually unplayable on a vanilla server. Most servers reset weekly so its also not fun getting your progression reset if you are a slow player that wants to improve your base gradually. Because of this grouping is considered almost mandatory to get anything done and also allows you to share blueprints or even boost each other to get a significant advantage over solo players. But the worst of all is the community. It was pretty common a while back for you to be able to actually talk to people and help each other out, or be left alone if you are naked just gathering resources. This is not the case anymore, where people will 9/10 times kill you on sight no matter what you are doing. Its unfortunate since KoS on a game like this makes it extremely unenjoyable for most people, but the 1% of the players voice of \"just git gud\" \"rust is a harsh game get over it\" always gets heard and nothing to solve this issue is changed since 2014. Driving away new players is never a good thing in games like this but the vocal minority of people insisting on a \"more hardcore experience\" completely ruined the game for me. I have been playing this game on and off since Zombies were a thing, and go on for a few hours hoping something has changed to make the game better every few months. Unfortunately, nothing that helps the game to not be a multiplayer arena sh*tfest has been implemented, which is why I can never recommend this game. EDIT 2018/03/20 The thing is, this game was originally designed as a survival game at the start. There was even a bit of PvE elements to it with zombies. I actually was following the game since there was a very limited number of keys and Garry was doing that auction type system thing to sell the keys, so people who are saying \"RUST WAS NEVER INTEDED AS A PVE GAME\" have no idea what they are talking about. I don't really think that going the PvP route was wrong per say, but it is a fact that the game changed their main focus since the actual release. Yeah it was early access and was to be expected sure, just nontheless a little bit dissapointed in the fact that Garry didn't really do anything to improve the non-PvP portion of the game since its release, apart from the very minor tweaks to the AI, which still has a bunch of problems like going through walls and water. Yes playing on a modded server does aliviate the grind a bit to something managable, but I really don't think \"oh if you are having trouble with the grind go to a modded server\" is the right approach to this problem. Its a problem with the core game that requires out of game influence to solve, where the main game's balance should be focused on a smooth experience. I get the appeal of making the game harder, don't get me wrong, I love hard games. Its just that the difficulty of this game doesn't come from actual game difficulty, but the fact that time commitment needed is so out of proportion to what the average gamer can play that its baffling why they don't do anything about it. I guess you could say that its not the right game for me but I one point I truely did love this game. There was a very fine balance of managable building and non-hositle players that made logging out with a wooden base fine. There was a time where you weren't forced to layer bases because C4s were so expensive that raiders only used them to raid large bases. There was a time where you could just spawn on the beach and make a campfire there and a lot of nakes will come gather around and talk around the fire. There was a time where you could ask a geared person for food and they would just drop food in front of you. I miss these things, but unfortunately, they probably won't be coming back."},

The game is now more aimed at people who don't have Families, friends, works or a life really. It has become so grindy it's no longer fun. Either remove the blueprints or remove the component system and remove upkeep for bases or at least nerf the amount of materials required for upkeep. A lot of us aren't willing to have to treat rust as a second job.. Stop aiming your game at no lifers and school students with nothing else to do. The community is also pretty toxic too. Chat is usually filled with Racism, sexism, Homophobic comments and generally people acting rather immature. Expect to get greifed, trolled and camped on a daily basis for no reason at all.. After you spend all you're time acquiring gear and loot for a decent base and can now actually have some fun shooting and blowing up stuff... Expect to wake up or come home from work and have no base as everyone only raids when you're offline even when they have 7+ guys in their clan."},

Its incredibly fun and addicting and can lead to some very funny and creative moments. Building and combat are fun and fair and the maps are amazing. Everything feels real and weighted like this is a real place, this adds to you wanting to do well. The harshness of building bases and getting good gear adds to the feeling of weight. I worked hard for this house and gun, so im gonna work hard to protect it! But sadly all of this is ruined by literally the worst community in any game I have ever played ever. You will probably see this in other comments but rusts community is incredibly toxic, hostile, and just downright cruel. its incredibly unfun to try and have interesting player interactions when everyone shoots on site. this ruins how fun rust CAN be by limiting player interaction to what is essentially a first person shooter. If your thinking of buying I would wait untill the devs find someway to fix this.

And then you will type in chat asking why they can't give you a break while you are trying to learn the game.  They will immediately follow up with \"That's Rust\" or some similiar platitude.  But the game is really good so you will eventually get over your rage and try it again and again and you will just repeatedly find yourself in the same scenario repeatedly.

Update 1:  Regarding the \"Hobbyist\" part: Hobbyist: a person who pursues a particular hobby. Hobby: A hobby is a regular activity that is done for pleasure, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. I'm not gonna pay you any more money or recommend this game to anyone since I'm not your \"bank\" for your own \"hobby\" needs. Neither this community needs to do so. In fact, if you gonna do this as a hobby, then refund everyone their money back, and turn this game to a F2P since it's a hobby right? Needless to say, I might be angry, but that doesn't give me any rights to swear or curse to any other human being.  So my questions are these to Garry Newman: - What was the goal/dream of this game when you first tought of it? - Are you satisfied with the things that are going at the moment? - Are you sure that you are using this community to the fullest extend for game improvements? (I'm talking about steam community, not reddit) To be honest, I already gave up for a refund, but I don't plan on playing this game anymore either even if it is in my library. Since the experience I had was a bad one... Update 2: I don't mind troll comments, but please, don't embarrass yourself... Update 3: * 23rd of November, 2017 * Ran the game again due to a request from a friend, by using the same rig that I've had when I've first wrote this review. The launch was a success, guess they've fixed their issue (after 2 years lol). Anyway, My friend suggested couple of servers which are located on europe, funny thing was, I couldn'T see those servers on my list so I've used friends tab to join that particular server that my friend was playing on since couple of game restarts and multiple refresh choices couldn't bring up those server names. Aside from that, my rig handled the game just fine on maxed out settings. Seen some improvements as well. Tho I've seen some weird stuff too. - Aparently there are still weekly wipes going on. (slightly do understand the reason but they should find an alternative permanent solution into this) - Nude female/male body seems ok and hilarious but I've seen some seriously messed up scenes and heard some really messed up conversations from what sounded like 13-14 yr old kids who shouldn't even supposed to play this game, they should add some type of age check based on steam registry or at least moderate to a certain amount before the game twitsts these young generations minds. Maybe even ban that account due to violations of bypassing age check? - Why can't I see all the servers? Had to use friend tab to join into their game server which wasn't showing up on the search. - Looks like some privately owned servers have these nice rules which limits teamplay to a certain amount which is quite nice since that way, you don't have to deal with a group of 4535654343 people ganging up on a single individual. I can imagine some questions will be asked so here's some answers before asked. * Yes, I'm still not recommending the game, it's 2017 and the game is still in alpha. * No, I still do not trust Facepunch Studios. * Yes, I did in fact said that I won't play the game 2 years ago, a friend of mine made me run it and I've just fulfilled his request since it's what friends does. * No, my rig is the same rig with same OS with same hardware. Nothing has changed for the past 2 years. But this time, the game launched without crashing."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "If you plan to play solo - DON'T BOTHER. Game was designed to play with friends or clans. If you play alone you will be severely disadvatged from minute one and you'll never catch up.  Let me describe typical first 20-40 hours of this game.  You start naked with stone. For the next several hours you'll be grinding away to collect wood and rocks to build a basic house (storage). Be prepared to get killed a lot during this stage by better geared people who run in groups.  Five hours later you have nice storage that should stand up to basics raiders. At this point you have to start going to high-risk areas swarming with better equipped people to collect \"blueprints\" that spawn randomly in bins. Now, without these blueprints you're stuck with basic gear and bow (no guns like you see in video, no armor etc.)  It takes A LOT of blueprints to get even a basic gun, problem is that to collect more of these you have to go back and forth to base, otherwise you're risking being killed (happens a lot) and being looted of all your hard-earned blue prints. Why going back and forth is a problem? Maps are huge and you typically spawn at the edge of the map near water. All the high-risk areas are towards the middle of map. It can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes of real time to walk to in one direction. Why not walk close to high-risk area and built house there you'll ask me? Because old-timers build their houses there first, typically right after monthly reset with group of buddies. So unless you log in to server right after reset and run close to airport and somehow manage to outplay local clan for territorial superiority, you're SOL. Hence, build house out outskirts of map where no one bothers to go to and walk for 5 minutes to find some bins.  If by some miracle you manage to collect enough blueprints (we're taking 1000+, when you typically get 20-50 per bin, which are pretty rare themselved) you have to build those weapons & armors using tier two materials (iron, gun powder) which you have to refine. That takes lots and lots of resources and can not be acomplished in one gaming session.  Now you log out for the day, having collected enough blueprints and accumilating some tier two materials. You'll get more tomorrow . . . you followed guides and built raid-proof honeycomb base . . . you'll be allright. Tomorrow comes, you log to game only to see your base raided and all your loot stolen. In some cases it would be pretty obvious(hole in wall, etc), but in a lot of cases you don't even see how it was breached. Hense the exploits and bugs in game which are constantly being used by hard-core gamers. There is no raid-proof base, hense there is no advacement in \"solo\" mode, you'll be outplayed by clans and groups in each case. They have collective power to get more resources, share gear, share C4, cover each other during raids, ganks lesser players in groups.  So now, 30 hours later you're back to square one and you dont' even know how your base was raided, you are nowhere near close to that gun or rifle. You're sitting naked with stone in your house\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665  Do you start over or go write a review about the game and move on? Your choice, I've made my.

{"recommended": false, "review": "Ok, before I start, ARK was (and still to some extent is) one of my most favorite games of all time. When I get on one of my nice, casual, single-player worlds, I have a great time. However, can I recommend it? Absolutely not it the state it's in now. In the beginning, ARK was an really good game for Early Access in my honest opinion. Sure, it had a bunch of bugs and an incredibly agrivating building system, but it was fine to accept for an early access title. Tons of people played it and tons of people loved it, including myself, even though I was pretty much somehow playing it on a potato with a few blinking lights and USB ports. Even though most times I didn't have the mental strength to play it, when I did, I had a swell time. Then came Scorched Earth. The Scorched Earth DLC pack, a DLC pack that was for a game still in Early Access, mind you, whilst being an OK DLC pack, marked the beginning of the end. It added new dinosaurs and a new map that many, also including myself, thought should've have merely been an update to the game. It also proved to many people that, instead of working on the many, many bugs and even the building system (which was still laughably bad, by the way), they were working on more content that merely added more bugs to the pool of already existing ones. Obviously, ARK lost a lot of followers and support. Between the point in which Scorched Earth was released and the free DLC, Ragnarok, was announced, time marched on as if Scorched Earth never even existed. No further support was given to it whilst Studio Wildcard added in new, vanilla dinosaurs. The only bit of major support SE was ever given was the addition of the Pheonix, which, at that point, couldn't coax players back onto the map in order to get it. Players had already done what Wildcard seemingly wanted them to do; they moved on. Ragnarok was released and people were fairly pleased. The map was interesting and new and was used for a long while. Granted, it was a fan created map, and there are some incredibly tallented map creators for ARK out there, but it was something new for everyone that played on consoles that couldn't use user created content (yes, ARK was released on consoles in this stage). However, even with the new map that added the Griffin, many things still weren't fixed, most importantly the building system that had gone years without repair. Everyone that could play on PC weren't adversly effected with the mod Structures+, but every player on console were having to suffer the ugly pillars that poked through the ceilings, the glitches in which a structure would snap to a point that wasn't even accessable, and the fact that if the surface you were building on wasn't perfectly straight, you were sh!t out o' luck. However, even then, they still held hope; Studio WC announced that they were planning on integrating S+ into the base game, and everyone erupted in glee. And then, sh!t hit the fan. Whilst Abberation was still under development, the STILL Early Access title was raised from the previous $29.99 to the wopping $59.99 it is now. Fans erupted with outrage, seeing that the title that was 75% completed at best was raised to the price of a full AAA game. At this point, ARK started rolling down hill at the velocity of a bullet train as SWC rushed the game to \"completion,\" leaving many of the bugs that had been there since day one in the game and declaring it a finished product when Abberation finally launched to the public. It was at this point, and the point we're still at today, in which ARK reached the lowest point of its lifetime, a point thought unreachable when it was first put into EA. Server preformance was garbage, S+ had never been implemented into the base game, the game was an unoptimized piece of rotten fruit that required the entire bulk of a well preforming gaming PC, the server browser was a complete joke, and there was NO WAY that ARK should've been released in the state that it was. And now, here we sit, with yet another game fed to the dogs that sh!t money. Was the game ever ready for release? No, my friend, no it wasn't. Now, we have a game that is STILL 75% completed at best selling for the price of a AAA title with a basic carbon copy dipped in glitter glue selling on the Steam storefront for half the price. Am I angry? Yes. Am I devastated? Also yes. I'm angry and sad that this can happen so easily to good games in EA, but, hey, it's Early Access. What you buy is never what you can expect years into the future. Fate, no, some developers in general, are cruel and choose making money over making a quality product that people can enjoy years after we've long passed on. I won't refund my copy, too late to now. However, what I can do is warn everyone. DO NOT BUY ARK IN THIS STATE! Do not give Studio Wildcard more money for this beaten and broken game! If everything changes, I'll change this reveiw as well, but for right now, even with how hard it may be to... AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE BLACK DEATH IN EUROPE OF 1350!"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "OK, I previously reviewed this before they announced an actual launch date.  I still stand by my initial review.  We played for over a year on an incredible community server.  There was still PVP but it wasn't what the PVP has turned into.  You want these big wars they advertise with you riding armies across fields to PVP.  Keep looking for a different game because you will never see that in this game.  We initially had uninstalled due to how toxic the player base got after cross server transfers.  We saw the new Isolated servers and thought wow, finally a way for people to enjoy the game.  My husband played for a day on one server before being trolled and losing everything while offline.  He started over on a new server and I joined him because everyone he was running into wasn't about just ruining his game. A few hours later we had a small house and a few riding tames.  I had just placed a feeding trough finally and was heading to my house to park and log off.  All of the sudden a guy on a raptor and a guy on a frog show up trying to kill me, so I get away becuase obviously after a few hours we have no defenses so I run. They proceed to blow a hole in the building I come back to ask why to which they then just keep me unconcious while they dump, not take my things just dump on the ground our entire morning of work.  Player base in this game is toxic, you can't enjoy it, you can't build, you can't tame because someone will just come along in a few hours and destroy it all again.  I stick with my initial review.  Do not waste your money!  Game is still super laggy, even on extremely low memory it overheats our pc's Some parts of maps are so glitchy you can barely make it through them.  It had the potential to be a great game but the humans playing it ruin any fun anyone gets. There is no need to attack people that have only played a few hours, have no turrets, live in stone and don't even have a dino that can eat other dinos.  That is just being a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665  That is what this game is full of.  If no one lets anyone build you can never have true PVP because OP players picking on new players is not PVP.  Add to that the fact that for the most part developers didn't listen to any of us when they made changes that affected gameplay, I mean why would you listen to the player base, what would they know about how your game actually plays.  Now a once awesome game was destroyed from the inside out.  Bad decision after bad decision and now they try to \"fix\" what they broke but the players are entirely too toxic to fix.  Players have found every way possible to exploit the game and find new ways to every day.  Maybe it's not just this game maybe it's just a sign of society in general.  I have noticed a change in the gamers out there no empathy, they cheat whenever they can, it's all me, me, me with most of them.  Time to go back to the way life used to be actually interracting with humans so you can actually see the pain in someone when you crush their soul.  Maybe it wouldn't be as easy to be such nasty cheating trolls in every game.  What's the point of a PVP game if you never let anyone build so they are actually a fight?  Oh I guess you aren't good enough to actually PVP so just keep trolling we'll go elsewhere and tell our friends not bother.  I was in an alpha for over a year, we intentinally let people build huge dfended bases so that we actually had a fight.  You know real PVP."},

Dev wiping for no reason, or in most cases, completely fabricated reasons, is rampant.   It is quite obvious that they play their own game, and treat the public servers as their own sandbox, and your success depends on their mood. Wiping long-time players for violation for rules that don't exist, then wiping the bases of any tribes that were ever associated with that player ..... then, literally, GIVING the resources from their vaults to another tribe.

{"recommended": false, "review": "This is how I wish the announcement of the paid DLC would have went down: \"We have recently settled a lawsuit in the order of 40 million dollars that we were obligated to pay out as a result of a broken non-compete clause.  Due to this most unfortunate oversight, we are now in need of additional funds to continue development of the game.  We are reaching out to the community in the form of a paid DLC that will give backers early access to tonnes of new items, creatures, and an awesome new map!  All of which will be available for free upon final release of the game.\" Had the release of the DLC gone down this way, I would have purchased the DLC without hesitation for myself, my girlfriend, and my best friend.  I can even live with the \"pay-to-win\" aspect of the DLC if it grants an advantage exclusively for Early Access.  Ideally however, there should be a way for non-dlc player to gain access to those technologies.  Something like a \"bring a tribemate\" system where as long as one person purchased the DLC, he/she is allowed to bring one or a few tribemates with them to the new area. An awesome incentive to purchasing the DLC before its contents would be available for free to all, (and besides its early access to the new content incentive), could have been tonnes and tonnes of awesome exclusive skins.  They really should have considered skin packs to help recoup their losses.  Not just equipment skins!  Literally change the skin of the animals.  Or really unique skins for walls and fences, or pretty much anything for that matter.  I would buy all of the above!      But nope;  They had to go the way of so many developers.  When will they learn that integrity and honesty will get them so much further with their fans.  Yes, I am a fan. A huge fan.  A hugely dissapointed fan. ..It's not too late to revert the horrid Paid DLC decisions: 1. Offer refunds to anyone that had purchased the DLC under the assumption that the content is permanently exclusive. 2. Offer an incentive not to get the refund: A tonne of exclusive skins, or whatever. 3. For those that choose to purchase the DLC after the changes to exclusivity are made also get tonnes of skins, just not the specific ones offered to the early DLC purchasers. 4. Sell skin packs.  Tonnes of them. To the Devs: Trust your blasted audience;  They already love your bloody game!"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Yes, I recommend this game if you play on a private server or solo game. I have played over 2000 hours of this game. I love it. The art is great, the game play is great, but the public servers are not so great.  ******************************************************** I do not recommend this game for public servers ******************************************************** Lots of griefing in this game, especially from the players located across the Pacific Ocean. On public servers I and my tribe mates have been warding off invasions. It becomes a chore and these invaders use hacks and cheats which destroy months and even a year's worth of hard work in very little time. With the re-instated server tansfer capabilities, it has gotten to the point where the game is unplayable and simply not fun. People blocking resources and not allying up is very problematic as well. Then if the invaders do take over various resources you and your tribe are hosed. The game is not balanced well for PVP, especially if the invaders have taken over other public servers, mining resources there and then transfering into your server. We've attempted blocking all the Obies and all the drops as to deter them and at the least trap them here. Unfortunately, that breaks the game play even more.  Within the discussions, there are a lot of complaints about these invaders from across the Pacific. These discussions often times are \"locked\" from replies and or are deleted in order to minimize the exposure of the problem rather than providing an answer for the problem. One answer would be to follow in the steps of other studios, where these particular group of people only have access to servers listed for their country/region. I do hope this issue becomes resolved one way or another. It is sad that such a great game can be ruined by social behaviors. Unfortunately, the culture of certain countries do not view cheating as a bad thing. In fact they view it as \"a win is a win, no matter how it's achieved\"."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "Fun game to play with friends, tons of hours spent roaming and trying to find each other, and all sorts of stuff. The game could use an update on more Zombie Textures, I didn't count but it seems like the game revolved around either 6 or 10 zombie models. Could be more, but the looks become repetitive, and you notice quite quickly a few hours in the game. The zombie AI also have a few things that should be reworked on. Mostly the main threat in the game is other players, but would be enjoyable if you made it harder for the players against zombies. Cause after investing a few hours in the game to scavenge loot and depositing them in the G.I. (Global Inventory) You get pretty stacked, and zombies do really little to no threat to you afterwards. Along with more zombie animations, since they mostly have these sets of animations: Walk, Run, Punch, Crawl/Dash?. Pretty much it, along with the super zombie who just kindaaa punches  you as he's chasing you. Feels like a type of MMORPG that has all these sorts of enemies in the game but they only do like 1 or 2 animations. But the problem is that Infestation doesn't /have/ all sorts of enemies. It has a few zombie textures, and one super zombie. Fun side: + Fun with friends    + Exploration    + Scavenging    + Using fences and sandbags to try and create makeshift bases.    + Trying to win back the items you've lost from people that killed you literally 5 minutes ago.    + Watching your friends get scared cause its their first time playing. Downside: - Repetitive after a few hours. - Killing zombies does not feel rewarding.   - They become repetitive.   - Zombie textures are limited.   - Zombie animations are limited and vague.   - Too easy to kill after a few hours of play.   - AI isn't really the best and could use a few tweaks. - Super Zombies also suffer from the zombie's problems   - Few animations, only punches. (That's it)   - Easy to corner and kill.   - Not that great of an AI.   - Not too rewarding after killing a few times. (The loot is plentiful - at most. But sometimes players look for a sense of accomplishment after defeating a boss in a game. The Super Zombie becomes too easy that it doesn't give that feeling. Don't mind me just reviewing for fun. Don't expect too much from the game, if you want to have fun! Cheers, and enjoy~"},

Make sure your gaming rig is up to date with updates and drivers. 2. Take the time to watch a few live streams of this game. Twitch or Youtube. 3. its fun with friends, so grab a few and play for free. NOW THE FIX'S 1.

Fredaikis AB has done a good job and they are very active with keeping the game fun."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "'m gonna post a honest review, as objectively as I can, because I, as well, have been with this title since the beginning and how it all went went south REALLY hard, which I will in no way defend. That being said, the reason I recommend is, is that while because the game is far from perfect, it has a special place for me, merely because of how much enjoyment I get out of it with friends. That being said, WARNING: DO NOT EXPECT A PROPER ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME WITH BASE BUILDING AND HUGE PVE AND LOOT ASPECTS. THIS GAME IS FAIRLY PVP FOCUSED AND YOU WILL SEE THIS IN THE LOOT SPAWNS FOR EXAMPLE. Do not go in expecting the ''next best thing'', because it's not and you'll be disappointed. The loot drops are abundant. You'll find guns very easily. You'll find bullets very easily. Looting is barely a chore, but to me, still very fun. You can decide to store it all in your global inventory or you can do it mostly like I do; loot a lot, but keep it all on you so when you die (and you will), you'll have to loot all over again instead of being decked out in elite gear right from minute 1. I only keep a few things in my global inventory, like ammo and snipers. The loot is so abundant because it's primarely a PvP game. I thought I would've disliked it, but it's not all that bad. The beginner servers are ridiculous loot wise, it's a bit better on the normal servers, but you won't have a hard time finding them. The anticheat they have in place so far seems to work. Is it flawless? Probably not but barely any anticheat these days is. Even huge AAA titles get hacked, so the fact it stops 99% of the hacks is pretty damn good and I haven't encountered one yet so far. These are DIFFERENT developers that bought the license from the previous devs/publishers. This is why they are listed as the publishers, but they do not actually control any of it. They've had an agreement on the license, nothing more. They do not hold any strings, because if they did, trust me it wouldn't be as free2play as it is now. Pay2Win? No, this game is not. Everything you can buy in the shop, you can buy with either in game currency or just loot it. The ONLY things you can buy with real life money are skins and even those are found in game. You cannot buy guns in the shop. You can buy ammo, but only with in game currency and it's not even expensive. You get a huge amount of dollars per zombie kill, so farming is worth it for that alone. There's barely nothing I haven't been able to buy, but i've actually did not buy a single thing in the shop, not even premium. So far i'm 100% free2play and it's EXTREMELY easy to loot. So people calling this pay2win has lost all meaning to the word pay2win and will slap it on anything that has a cash shop. To them even World of Warcraft is pay2win because you can buy a level 100 character. Or battlefield. Or any other game with microtransactions. This game isn't for everyone, i'll admit that. It'll be left with a very experienced veteran community player base that will make your life hell in game. It's not beginner friendly if you're not going in with the idea that you want to learn the game. If you want a loot based survival game, this will probably not be for you. However, do you want a PvP game with actually solid mechanics (even this you can argue about, but it's all opinions) while you have to loot for food and guns/ammo on the side? This game could possibly be it for you. Graphical wise, this game isn't good. I mean I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the most ugliest game ever, but it certainly isn't th\u00e1t pretty. It has a lot of missing textures, the animations are clunky and overall leaves a lot to be desired to. Graphical wise this game hasn't improved much if any, but hey, let's face it, we all didn't buy minecraft for the graphics either, now did we? Or played runescape because it's ''so pretty''? While it's not the ugliest game out there, it's very noticeable that graphical wise, the game is unfinished and if you're a graphic \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, you'll be extremely annoyed at it. Hell, even I was a bit and usually graphics (considering the gameplay is nice, that is) don't bother me too much. But be warned, graphically you'll probably dislike it if you care about it a lot. Long story short; it's a game with a long, bloody history and while I totally understand people steering away from it, I encourage you to jump in with a friend and try it for a few hours. I am fairly confident you'll be put into an exciting situation that'll leave your heart racing, because despite all the hate, despite the fact the game is currently merely a fan made game, it brought me one of the best moments in gaming in general and not many games have been able to do that for me. If you want a PvP based game with looting on the side and farming zombies on the side, you might enjoy it. Just do not expect this perfect survival zombie shooter with PvP on the side, because that is NOT what it is. It's not for everyone."},
{"recommended": true, "review": "While i get it people are mad over the old devs of WarZ, if people give this a try they will enjoy it i think so. This game is not p2w the only thing you get with premium is free respawns thats it nothing else, the anti-cheat is amazing for a game like this i havent met 1 hacker yet for the 200 hours i have on steam and the other hunders i have off steam. The PVP experience is the most fun and addictive by far. The game has bugs and stuff, but come-on nothing that will ruin your experience and also this game has a small dev team so cut it some slack. In a nutshell people need to give this game a try and see how fun it can be"},
{"recommended": true, "review": "The game was warz then that game ended. New Z a different game site started up the game changed hands then it came to steam. The game enginje is the same to a degree it is a different game. I downloaded it and began to play.  Some things have stayed the same other things were added like new loot spawns some play areas on the map were removed and some new areas added. Ok cool I began to play. The anti cheat  for the most part does work. The dev team has done more than the previous warz/iss ever did. That being said here is my take on this game it is fun stress relief at best.  You play to have fun till the crashes and freezes start then curse the game only to renter to see you died by zombie or another player while you tried to exit. You do get some support for this but don't exspect the problems to be easily fixed. I have played for slightly 1800+ hrs yeah the game is addictive. Until now lol. Download and see for yourself what the statement says for you ((:P. suggestions for in-game play: Don't paly with players you don't know reason they tend to stab you in the back in-game. Not all of them do but some will group with you to see what you are about if they don't like what they see you might be the victum.  Start out playing in servers with only a few players in them and don't tell them where you are located.  When looting for snipers you will eventually find one stay in that zone. Exit out away from buildings. Hop servers in the same zone you found the first sniper. Go though that same zone in every server you will find more snipers in that area/zone. When in different servers the spawn location of the next sniper might be different in other words, you found one in server 2 you go to server 5 and you find one on the roof the first one was inside a building all in the same zone just different servers. Play in less populated areas. I found most of the good loot not far up the hill from Frosty Pines and at Lone Tree Farm hint hint. Just be careful of the super zombie at Lone Tree the object is go through the side entrance and get on to the roof. It takes 100 to about 150 rounds to kill it use a pkm or fn249 don't worry about the noise. The sz will die it will only be for a moment they also can drop premo loot. You can at Lone Tree Farm will sometime get a wood box spwned in as well as other areas on the map they have snipers in them and sometimes different loot so grab um up. Don't bragg that you got any cool loot someone will kill you for it it does happen to too many new players in-game. In other words keep it to yourself unless you have a death wish. I have always played alone. From the warz days I learned to hop servers to stay alive and after killing some other player. It's not cowardness for leaving it's just staying alive to kill again. The reason everytime you die to another player the  accuracy kill ratios change you lose a little but not your rank/reputation. The player you killed sometimes comes back for revenge and you might of got lucky once why take the chance and find out that was all it was then you get killed.  If you can adjust the lighting provided you have a monitor with various modes for gaming adjust it. The night even the game lighting for daytime as well changes after every patch/hotfix that is a constant problem.  Don't always shoot zombies and if you do use a silencer. Players can tell by sound where you are use a sword or other melee wepond when starting out.  Jump up on a box or van some zombies can climb up on cars and the engine hood of the trucks so kill them from above. Try to get higher or run they will chase you they have a limit on how far they can run.  When they like the sz are at their limit turn and take a step twords the herd they will step foward and stop. In most cases that locks their distance. Use the wepond of choice stay arms lenght from them and rack them up. SZ you have to shoot, med up when it stikes you then turn when is is at it's limit and kill it. I have had to uninstall the game the last patch/hotfix is causing the game to freeze and it is no longer playable.  The game freezes and blue screens, my specs are up to date. It is not my video card or connection speed that is causing the problem it is this game. No othe game I have or play does this to my pc I'm done with this problem. This game is free to download/play and see for yourself if you like it. It is/was in my case fun while it lasted. My pc is woth more to me than this free to play crashing blue screen frozen game is worth to continue to play for me. I have spoke to support the try this does not resolve the problem. I will not risk my pc crashing and having to be hard shutdown from an unresponsive game I'm done. I uninstalled this fun while it lasted game and requested a self ban by my choice. Bye New Z and as the Zombies say when they kill you in game RIP I'm done. Thanks for reading lol((:XD."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "After 1070 hours in game I'm uninstalling. Devs will not listen to player base at all. The game is being killed. With every patch they add more content/bugs to a game that is already so buggy and glitchy already. FIX THE BUGS AND AI PATHING. You can't ride a land based tame without getting snagged on every little thing on the map. I've lost so many tames to these glitchy maps it's stupid. PVE is boring and ruined by the devs last patch, PVP is completely unbalanced and not real PVP at all. There is no way to defend a base on this game at all. You can try all you want but the larger tribe WILL get in.  Offensive strategies are too strong compared to the little bit of defenses available. Cross ark transfers were the first stage of the devs killing the game, the flyer nerf was the second.  I hope you enjoy boring farming at stupidly low rates just to watch your work be taken by somebody else while you're offline. Ark PVP servers have become toxic in a way that you can't let your kids play either. This game has a stupid amount of potential if the devs would just listen...Don't waste money on this game until it is complete and done in all aspects. The early access has been used as an excuse for every bad point of the game, while not being addressed AT ALL. Wait for reviews on the COMPLETE FINISHED version before buying. EDIT, It's been a long time since this was written and the game is getting much better. Devs are listening to the community finally and gameplay is getting better. PVP is still actually player vs base but slightly more balanced. Officials are still as toxic as ever, and mega tribes still ruin them. Now they are ruining the small tribe servers as well. BLDX and TEA need dev wiped."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "TL;DR: Bite the bullet and pay for a private server with your buddies if you want to have any fun. In the newest trailer for ARK, a naked man awakes on a beach with no idea what the hell is going on. Seconds later, he's killed by a woman riding a raptor and wielding an AK-47 simply for the crime of existing. While this was a wonderful cinematic that was meant to promote the game positively, it incidentally showed potential players the single WORST part of the game and the reason you should avoid it entirely. Unless you're planning on playing on a private server with friends, which will cost you at least $15 a month, you're guaranteed to only enjoy playing ARK if you get incredibly lucky. And I mean -incredibly- lucky. You may even find better luck on public servers if you have a friend who's got 5,000+ hours in game and can supply you with everything to get started. I've tried no less than 24 times to start fresh on public servers, and here's just a sampling of the things that've happened to me: - Chased down by a three men riding Tyrannosaurs because I tried harvesting fiber on \"their beach\" - Tranquilized with a scoped rifle, handcuffed, siphoned for my blood and left on a raft floating in the middle of the ocean - Tamed my first dinosaur, logged off for a grand total of an hour and logged back in to find both my beloved parasaur and everything I'd made from cloth and wood stolen, burned to the ground, etc. - Tranq'd (again) after I logged on, regained consciousness only to find my inventory stuffed with dinosaur poop. - Had my entire box of berries and (albeit stolen) eggs raided and replaced with large dinosaur poop. - Finally, and I mean FINALLY got to the point where I'd made a friend and we'd built a small base together near a waterfall off of the tundra. Left for maybe 10 minutes to tame some pterosaurs so we could fly, and returned to find the server admin astride a massive bronto smashing everything we owned because \"it was his waterfall\" The community is toxic, the game actively punishes you for logging off, and no matter how much progress you make you'll NEVER be guaranteed anything besides a swift and unjust end. Think you can lock your base's door and log off inside to be safe? Wrong again. Someone will just bust down the wall and drag your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665outside to execute you for the crime of not playing the game 24 hours a day.  I had fun ONLY when I was on a private server with friends and we took the time solely to have fun and build massive cities in the wildnerness. The game HAS potential, but even now it's just sadistic garbage that punishes people for trying to play the game without some kind of helping hand on their side long before they start playing. Either get a friend who's lost his job because of all his ARK hours, or get your own server and never deal with the community at large. Red pill or blue pill. Which will you take? It doesn't matter; one's cyanide and the other's a placebo that'll give you diarrhea."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "After 1500 hours in ark, I'm willing to give a review and it's really a word of warning. Read all the other negative reviews, they aren't exaggerating. Either give up any life you had in real life Ark to play this ark, because you can't have both. When you spend hundreds of hours farming a base and taming dinos, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours maintaining that, because if you aren't constantly growing your defenses and and watching all your assets, a zerg tribe from some far off country and server will come and wipe everything you had, and not even feel a little bad about it.  And when you go to take your favorite battle Quetz loaded with Ascendant weapons and armor to seek revenge on those block lettered tribes that killed all your passive tames you spent hundreds of hours on.... It'll despawn. With the last of your precious things. And the Developers won't help get any of it back. Ark is a game that you can spend 18 hours on a day, and the moment you go to sleep, someone in an opposite timezone will come and take all your things. Don't sleep long, because they will spend the entire 6-8 hours you sleep tanking all your defenses, slowly sliding their way into the most intimate parts of your base, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's a cold blooded game that will destroy everything around you. If you want a life, turn around and run. Play some FPS that you can turn off and walk away from and not start over again.  Please read the reviews. It's a game you will hate to love.  It's a bad kind of addicting. It's like meth or coke, you'll want to leave, but you just can't quit."},

{"recommended": true, "review": "A lot has happened since I started playing this game and wanted to give my input and recommendations for anyone that wants to check it out. First:  It's free and for a free game, I'd say it's a good and entertaining. If you want game development and optimization that you get from the big companies, buy from the big companies instead.  It can be buggy at points, but it is worth it to report bugs as long as you're reporting the bug and not cursing out the devs. I recommend tweaking the settings yourself first and you may find more stability if you need it. Secondly, The zombies seem a little strong, but that's the game balancing for you. It would be worse if the zombies died with one or two shanks to the arm or chest; no incentive to be better prepped to enter certain areas. When in doubt, shoot or swing for the dome  Yeah there are players all over the maps most times that are out to kill you and take your loot, but there is a safe way to play or \"farm\" as they say and stock yourself up with critical equipment. For the players that don't want to spend money on the game and get around the pesky wait-to-be-revived times, make multiple characters. (Open world and survival only) The fact that there are a few different modes made available to players is a big plus... -Open World where there's a good deal of equipment lying around on a big map -Survival where supplies and equipment are much more scarce on a big map -PVP/Battle Royale style modes where your main focus is elimination of other players and less so the zombies on smaller maps -Even practice servers that allow you to play against others and not lose any gear when killed; the only loss of equipment is from the player's own use/consumption (ammo/meds/etc.).

Some years later I installed the game again and played it for some hours to get some of the achievements and I came to this conclusion: If you expect a Flatout as you used to know: DO NOT BUY!!! Well if you expect a game that looks like a bad Flatout clone and is not perfect at all then you could maybe enjoy this one. It's actually fun to play to be honest but you need some time to get used to it and you always have to tell yourself that this is not Flatout... At least there is game mode that puts you in a splatter car telling you to kill some zombies on the road .... every game is better with zombies and so is Flatout 3. If the game wouldn't be called Flatout it would just be some \"not that good\" car game I wouldn't recommend either but as a part of the Flatout game series it feels like a malicious deception to make some money with the good name of Flatout."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "I'd rather tea-bag a Bear Trap than to play that ever again. Go play Flatout 2. Now!"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "Flatout was one of those games that I found on GOG and decided to try. I didn't expect much, but there was a sale, and I picked the game up for $1.90. The instant I got into a race I knew that the game would be good. There was mayhem, car bits smashing everywhere, tires all over the road, explosions after colliding with barrels. The game was fun, and to this day the original Flatout is one of my favorite racing games. So when I heard that there was going to be a Flatout 3 (Sequel to Flatout 2, which was also a great game,) I was excited. I waited the week until it came out, (I should've known something was up, they only announced the game a week before it was released!) and promptly bought the game off of Steam. Once it had finished downloading, I started the game up to see if it was a worthy successor to the game that I had loved. The first thing I did was check out the graphics options. I have a fairly fast computer, so I maxed everything out. I headed into a race. There were several classes of cars to choose from, and one of the classes was Classic. The car looked decent, so I chose it. After a loading screen with an unmoving bar, I was in. From the start, I was shocked. I won't tell you the specifics of this race, I'll just break it down by category: Physics One of the best things about the previous Flatout games was the tight sense of physics. It wasn't quite a simulation, but it was realistic enough that you had to be careful not accidentally hit something solid and crash. It also had excellent car damage, and the cars dented and crunched realistically. With Flatout 3, all of this was thrown out of the window. Cars in Flatout 3 handle like they do in those racing games at the arcade. When you're driving them, you don't really have a sense of control like you do in a real car. They feel way too fast, and also very light. They are also very difficult to control. The cars in Flatout 3 have all of these traits. They just don't have the tight sense of control that previous games had. Instead, they feel like someone modded the game files to make things more hectic. Honestly, it just feels bad. Gamemodes If there was one thing that I thought Flatout 3 had going for it, it was it\u2019s gamemodes. It has a varied lineup that looks like it could be fun to play, but still manages to fail. The modes are: Race, Stunt Man, Big Battle, Battle Arena, Monster Trucks, Speed, Nightshift, Offroad, and Challenge. Race is the obvious one. Race around a track, and the first to complete the predetermined number of laps wins. Nightshift is actually identical to race, the only difference being that all of the courses are at night. Race mode lacks depth, but this can be forgiven seeing as there\u2019s only so much you can do with a lap race. Even so, the mode really isn\u2019t very good. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s bad as it is, it\u2019s just kinda boring. Stunt Man is the classic minigame mode from the previous games. In it, you launch your driver through the windshield to accomplish various tasks. An example would be the high jump. You would drive down a long track until you reached a high net. You would hold down the nitro button to adjust the angle, then release to see how high your driver would be launched. It sounds horribly sadistic, but it really was quite fun in the previous Flatout games. Not so in Flatout 3. The reason for this is simple, and this is essentially the reason the game is so bad: The physics engine quite simply fails. You just can't launch your driver like you could in the previous games. It feels cheap, kinda like a bad iPhone game. The physics just don\u2019t perform like they should in the situation. It ruins it. The next two modes are Big Battle and Battle Arena. In these modes, 8-24 cars are thrown into an arena. A car wins by destroying all other cars in the arena. This is essentially the Derby mode from the older games. This mode sounds fun when I describe it (and it was in the last two games), but it\u2019s terrible in Flatout 3. The reason for this is (once again) the incredibly poor physics engine. Cars fly around as if they were made of paper. A car trading paint with you does 50% damage to you, whereas a T-bone collision only does 20%. And don\u2019t even get me started on the explosions. Unfortunately, this gamemode feels like a cheap knockoff of the established mode from the other games. Monster Trucks is unique, and it is the highlight of the game. In this mode, your only cars are (guess what) monster trucks. You can then choose from five gamemodes. The first is Search and Destroy, which is a timed dash to destroy 40 barrels on the map. The second is Bring the Light, in which the goal is to bring 5 objects into a container. The next mode is Catch the Bus. In this mode, you have to knock over 5 double decker busses as fast as possible. The fourth is Royal Flush, where players roll a mine into the sewer. The final mode is Dude, Where\u2019s My Car, which is similar to Search and destroy, only with car wrecks instead of barrels. These modes aren\u2019t terrible to play like the other modes, and can actually be enjoyed. Unfortunately, this enjoyment is short lived, and it soon falls to the mundaneness of the rest of the game. Speed attempts to play like a F1 racer. All of the cars are Formula 1 cars, and the tracks are similarly themed. However, this simply doesn\u2019t work. The combination between Flatout 3 and F1 2012 is a match made in hell, and the mode fails horribly. Offroad is kinda interesting: The goal is to get from Point A to Point B in as fast as possible. Playing the game reminds me of an old game called Fuel that I once had. The premise is interesting, but there\u2019s so much junk everywhere on the track that its a nightmare to drive, especially with the physics engine that stubbornly refuses to go away. The final mode is challenge. This basically sets up specific scenarios in the previous gamemodes with goals you have to complete. This could be something like a time trial, or a race where your goal is to deal a certain amount of damage or wreck x number of cars. It fails to impress, just like everything else in this game. Graphics Sometimes graphics can warrant the purchase of a game. You may buy a game just to show off your computer, and that\u2019s alright every once in awhile. This isn\u2019t one of those games. The graphics are flatout terrible! (See what I did there!) The game just doesn\u2019t look good. The cars always seem kind of squashed when you look at them, and they're low enough poly to be in a GameCube game. In fact, the entire game looks like a GameCube game. Here\u2019s some examples to prove my point: If the GameCube one were higher resolution, it would beat out Flatout 3 easily. Sound Er, no. Just no. This game has terrible sound. The main theme gets old and repetitive. Cars sound like RC cars. Collisions have no force in them. And just about everything else sound really bad. It doesn\u2019t help that this game has no soundtrack, which means you\u2019re stuck listening to crappy music that someone wrote in a day. Words can\u2019t describe just how bad it sounds. It really is pathetic. Conclusion If you haven\u2019t figured out by now, this game is terrible. Unfortunately for the studio that made this, the reason I feel it was so terrible was because of the Flatout label. Everyone who had played the original expected it to be the same. It just wasn\u2019t. This game might have been decent it it wasn\u2019t called Flatout 3, but because it was, it is terrible. There really wasn\u2019t anything going for this game, and I\u2019m truly sad to see how a previously excellent franchise fell flat. Graphics: 0/10 Horribly dated graphics manage to look worse that Flatout 2. Sound 0/10 Just no. Almost like they realized they needed sound a day before it was released. Controls: 3/10 Racing games should not be played on the keyboard. When a controller was used, cars randomly careened out of control. Gameplay: 3/10 Very little enjoyment in the game."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "I've been playing this game since it was on the 360 and have enjoyed the content for the most part, aside from the horribly toxic community killing anything that moves, modders ruining every aspect possible, trolls making missions and heists unbearable and so on. I would enjoy this game more if you could do Motor Cycle Club, CEO work, and the other money making portions in private or solo lobbies. Despite all my issues with this game, the long loading times, all of it, I did find it enjoyable with friends.  And then it happened. I got hit with a random perma ban for simply playing the game. I honestly don't know what else it could have been aside from a false flag from the ban bot or users not knowing that the MK II Heavy Sniper can have explosive rounds... Maybe players should just leave players alone unless they want a fight? If you wanna fight, don't cry when you get killed, especially since I never liked the PvP in this game, I honestly avoided players at all times cause I got tired of trying to figure out which one was a modder or not.  So, until my ban gets lifted and Rockstar can figure out that we should be able to fight to get to play this game, I'm leaving this as a negative review and a warning for anyone who wants to play this to play this game, do so at your own risk. Cause that damn bot will not give a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665when it bans you and Rockstar will do nothing to change it. Edit: Since this review has been gaining some traction, I feel I may want to clear some stuff up, especially now that I'm less frustrated at the joke that is Rockstar support.  Honestly, I despise cheaters and modders in games where the progression is the grind cause you sell yourself short of the satisfaction of having worked up to your goal and getting the thing you wanted and worked for. Not saying that the stupid prices for stuff in this game is fair, but it does feel satisfying to finally get something... Only to turn around and ask why the hell I needed this thing in the first place. Though I get it. Some people want the instant gratification that comes with mods and modded money, but  for me, that would just help kill the game even more for cause then it begs the question, \"Why bother playing this game in the first place?\" You can get literally anything and everything you want at the push of a button and at no effort on your part other than a Google search. I don't like cheating and modding cause it feels dirty and wrong. Hell, I don't even really use mods in single player games till I've beaten the story to try and get the full experience of the game before going back and seeing what I missed, other options and choices if possible, or just seeing how badly I can break the game. But only in single player games where I'm not messing with other people's experiences, cause I'd honestly hate for someone to do the same to me in return. That's just my stance on it, I know some people are gonna laugh and scoff at it, but I just thought I'd put this out there. Thanks for talking your time to read this, or at least skim over it. TL;DR  Singleplayer is fun and enjoyable as long as the next update doesn't keep resetting your progress. Online is a battlefield and everyone and their mother will try to kill you. Play at your own risk. Money is gonna be a constant grind to get cause of how overpriced the fun stuff is, but in lobbies, you're probably gonna get blown up no matter what you do. There's ways to make solo lobbies. Keep it close and ready at all times and play with groups of friends whenever possible."},

This is a clear cash grab that comes days after the CEO of Take Two stated that the company is under monitizing the GTA playerbase.  The company doesn't think your $60 purchase of their game is enough, so they want to force you into the horrendously grindy GTA Online so you will give in and buy Shark Cards, because you cannot experience the Online portion of the game without millions of dollars, and with the rate at which they trickle money to you, you are encouraged to part with more of your hard earned money to play the game that you already spent $60 buying."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "When I bought this game on Jul 6, 2015, and played it for the first time it seemed amazing. There weren't that many cheaters around, Rockstar weren't pushing their shark cards so hard yet. The amount of money needed to get something was considerate. Like top apartments were $200'000, cars cost hardly over $500'000 and you could easily get your first million simply by playing each heist just one time. Then bikers came out introducing new ways of making money with biker businesses. Which were then greately nerfed after a while. Rockstar began to push their shark cards harder and began to fight the competition they themselves made. That was the first time I noticed Rockstar being greedy and cutting players' income to make it harder for them to grind the money in game making them feel like they need to invest real $$ to get some in-game $$. After that CEO import\\export with crates and stolen vehicles came out which, again, at first allowed players to earn some nice money pretty fast. And guess what happened next? Rockstar nerfed the income yet again making it hardly profitable for the players. And at the same time the prices kept growing wild. Like some cars costing over $2'000'000, apartments costing over 1 milion providing no extra features. Hardly useful mobile operation centers costing 1.5-2 million. And shark cards popping up everywhere like a real annoying advertisement in real life. Then in June 2017 Gunrunning came out which was a blast in moneymaking compared to any previous activities and remained the best way to make money in GTA Online for a while. At last I was able to keep up with crazy prices on cars, bikes, guns, and all sorts of customization in game (still taking up insane amount of time to grind though, but at least \"the price was right\") That remained the case up untill late february \\ early march of 2018, when I noticed my sales shrank in half. And this time, since it happened recently, I am able to state some real numbers: For a year I was able to pay $75'000 to get a full stock of supplies for my bunker. Which then produced me an amout of guns worth of $420'000 per one sale using a single vehicle. Meaning I had a net profit of $345'000 per one single sale playing solo. And as of today the numbers shrank down to just $210'000 per sale, but I still have to pay the same $75'000 for the supplies and wait for the same amount of time for these weapons to manufacture which makes my net profit $135'000 (down from $345'000). That's $210'000 less than it used to be PER ONE SALE. The exact same thing happened to EVERY DLC activities earlier. I just can't memorize the exact diffirence in numbers for those older changes, but the effect was the same every time. I stopped doing these older missions since they became hardly profitable. And this time the gunrunning is gonna be my next abandoned facility :( Now let's move on to another huge problem of this game: CHEATERS. Rockstar made only one good attempt in fighting modders for real. JUST ONCE. When they decided to completely prohibit the use of any modification for GTA Online, which then resulted in a huge outbreak of negative reviews on Steam which spooked Rockstar to the bone. And they quickly reverted these changes completely removing such protection within a couple days. Allowing r\u0435t\u0430rd\u0435d individuals to keep on griefing on other players using mods. And nothing has changed ever since. This is why I AM NOT GOING TO BUY and DO NOT RECOMEND you to buy ANY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR in the future. Rockstar used to be a great company making masterpiece games. But they became corrupted by these filthy greedy marketologists, and began to penalize their loyal and honest players with income cuts, crazy in-game prices and long grind times while allowing cheaters and modders to thrive on, completely ruining GTA Online. ROCKSTAR, STOP BEING GREEDY AND MAKE YOUR GAME GREAT AGAIN!"},
{"recommended": false, "review": "So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month. At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final.  I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up.  At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed.  Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.   So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

{"recommended": false, "review": "If you are looking for a great singleplayer experience, you can ignore this review. You're getting what you pay for there. If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me. After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards. Cheers."},

{"recommended": false, "review": "Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying \"surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/\u00a360+ for?\" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer. The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that.  Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that. Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called \"Smuggler's Run\" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was \"modded or cheated money\". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game. Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game. Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online. This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself. Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't. Update 2: Left another ticket  to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted god damn response AGAIN. This reponse took them over a week to type."},
{"recommended": false, "review": "They fixed the anti-modding thing, but sadly there are still problems with the game. -Single player is no longer being updated with new weapons or anything. -Multiplayer is full of toxic players and cheaters. -Shark cards are overpriced, currently without a sale the most expensive is $100, and that gets you $8,000,000. I'll still play this, but there are a lot of problems that I have with the way this game is moderated."}
